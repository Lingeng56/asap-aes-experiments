Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was there choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'      @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did. It's there own fault.     For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off  the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what we will be able to read or listen too",3,3,3,4.0

One obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable.

If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since its a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

3199,2,"Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries.        Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that effect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish. Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information. Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I dispise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people i know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are.         So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We cant hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then were left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy",4,4,4,6.0
16529,6,"Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were, to get it to work. For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable When docked to the building.

3372,2,"Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.",3,3,3,4.0

14971,6,"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on. Everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas.

4296,2,"Dear Newspaper,      I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magizines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library.  I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate.      In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.       Books about drugs are alright to an extent.  If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much.  We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.      Books about alcohol are the same way.  We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk.       Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school. The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it.     I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about.  I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun.

15495,6,"The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building.

Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.",5,5,10,8.0

3416,2,"I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them.      School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups. If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out. The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song.      Movies should be age appropiate too. Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section.          Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides no ones making you check out that book",3,3,3,4.0

I had @CAPS7 friends yet and I was to shy to go and join any of the groups so I walked to all of my classes alone. Students would get in my face wanting to know what school I came from and wanted to know all about me. I remember wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls would ask @CAPS5 I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another. I chewed on my lip looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me.""@CAPS1 I'm @PERSON3, what's your name?"" was a skinny boy in a black caps response to me. ""@PERSON1"" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time.""That's a pretty name, I'm @LOCATION1, this is @LOCATION2, you just met @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 is the funny kid next to you with his orange back pack,"" I smiled and nodded to them @ORGANIZATION2 had on a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 t-shirt and @PERSON2 had on a military uniform that said @CAPS4.

They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone even including me.""@CAPS5 that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash.""

I busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned @PERSON2 said,""@CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like your going to eat something and like your angry."" @PERSON2 handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for @PERSON2 to send the picture to each of them.""I was wondering @CAPS5 I could be your guys friend?"" I asked looking them all in the eye. @ORGANIZATION2 was the only one to respond,""@CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @PERSON1 duh @CAPS5 we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you."" @ORGANIZATION2 teased. My twisted gut loosened with re-leaf.""@CAPS8 we probably would have made some excuse to leave,"" @PERSON3 smiled.

Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses.

Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness.",4,4,4,10.0
21251,8," Laughter has many benefits; happiness, joy, bonding with others,adreneline, the helping of releasing tension, and the joking that is made on a daily basis around you. Laughter is something that can be shared among people especially when they're in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up anyday and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a huge part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends, and stangers laughing has always been a big deal to me. I love being able to look at someone and see that they smile alot, which means that they probaly laugh alot and that they are a happy person. How can I tell this. Well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes. Really the crows feet don't matter about how old you are they can happen from laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. The biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason the relationships will last longer is because you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are fine with laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughing in an relationship is the best part. Lets say your partner is in the dumps, are you just going to let them be moody all day or are you going to try to make them laugh and cheer them up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody I try my hardest to cheer them up. I love to make people laugh. And when I'm being a grouch my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or they just comfort me to see what is wrong. So if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore it will not work out between you and the person you're with. So spread the joyfullness of life and and make people happy. Another part that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you I'm shy at first, but once I warm up to you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Like most of my friends will say is that I am weird, but I enjoy laughing alot and making others laugh too. When I'm around my friends and in the dumps someone will always in the end will get me to laugh. No matter how upset I am they can always get me to laugh at pretty much anything, since I am a really easy person to entertain. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act. They are always finding some way to be funny and annoying. Such as being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others will never do because it's embarassing. Well just because it is embarassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least do it. If you don't do it, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention to ourselves. How are you suppose to know whether or not it's funny if you don't want to try something new. How are you suppose to laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you no matter how stupid it is. So don't knock it until you try it. The person that once said, "" laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is it true or false? Is this really the shortest distance or the longest? I honestly believe that is could be the a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time or you will never make friends or have any relationships. And if you don't have friends or any relationships then who will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. If you're not a happy person then how are you to experience the joys of life and everything around you. You won't, so put a smile on you face and be a spontaneous person who is not afraid. Laughter is a benefit to all man kind. And laughter in my life has showed me so much, it has brought me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those enjoyments that have been explored, are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. This is one emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up anyday and bring happy expressions to every ones faces. Share the laughter.",20,20,40,6.666666666666667

After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  ,14,15,29,4.833333333333333

A lot of people in the world today are having this same question.  Some parents think they should be removed, but others argue they should stay.  I'm going to tell you what i think.      As a citzen,  I know some parents are arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the libary if they are found offensive.  Well if they do that then there wouldn't be anything on the shelves in the libary would be shut down.  I mean i see where some of the parents are coming from some of these things are offensive and not apporaite for children, but if you dont want your children to see it them keep them away from that section of the libary or don't bring them, you go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them.       In the world today everything is offensive to someone in the world i mean everyone has there own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So eventually if you were to take everything offensive out of the libary it would be emptied out.  I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.  But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work i abhor- then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else.

When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don't know how to another a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great.I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but theres no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computers chat you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When your on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer.",4,4,8,6.0

First off as stated in para graph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds leading to the stregthing and modification of the steel frame. Thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most drigibles are very flammable. They consist of Helium, which is a extremly flammable gas. Also if the drigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densly populated area of people.

These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored.

3875,2,"Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today.  Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated.  Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression.  The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children.  Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids?  Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution.       Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word.  In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship.  It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise.  For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1.  While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored.  People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them.  While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not.     There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands.  If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material.  However, the issue changes completely when one considers children.  If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business.  However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things.  Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them.  In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development.       When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned.  If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain.  However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations.  Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters.  Then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section.  When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there.  This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults.  Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library.  After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material.       In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully.  When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly.  However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression.  Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.  If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands",5,4,5,8.0

411,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with real people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with real people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply dont learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they cant feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a persons words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the worlds currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.",6,6,12,10.0

4514,2,"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves",4,4,4,6.0
4031,2,I dont thank so due to the fact that most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public.  if the person or persons find the peice of material offending then they should pass the item.  or they can skim over it.  on the other hand the person or persons does have the right to freedom of speech but should not exceed their opinion above the level of the law.       if music is played in the library that others do find offended then in my opinion yes they should and can speak up for their rights.  books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended.  this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books.  this is because people hav different personalities which mean we wll like different things.  that does not mean that others can not speak their opinion because like i said earlier every one in the united states of america has the right to speak what is on their mind even though it @MONTH1 not be what others want to hear they can still do it.     well that is my opinion on what i think should happen.,3,3,3,4.0

Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it.

The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause.

30,1,"Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work.

As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable.

Positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book.      Magazine is another non neccasary object that is place in the library. A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it.

1221,1,"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor. Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Now is the time to decide if you should support computors. The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work.

This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since",3,3,3,7.5

Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, search for the info and turn it off takes more time than find a book, open it, find the info close it and put it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take time to find into than a book. Computers give you too much information than a book. There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer.

He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell @CAPS1, but not today.

15074,6,"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to.

My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.",4,4,8,6.0

21582,8," I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have maid people laugh. One time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and I looked out the window and saw a sign. ""@CAPS1 butts, unless, that ""@CAPS2"" is an ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 must be @CAPS1 @CAPS4."" I said. @CAPS8 was so funny i maid everyone in the car laugh. @CAPS7 later on, on the drive to camp with my friends we stopped at @CAPS5 in some city. When we stopped there I got inside a shopping basket and my friends and I were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh. When we where going to leave I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car I crabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the doughnuts where really gross. The doughnuts tasted so dry, @CAPS8 was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and I had to drink my chocolate milk with my doughnut just to make @CAPS8 taste a little bit more sweet. None of us had anymore doughnuts. @CAPS8 was so funny, we threw the doughnuts out the window. On the way back from the camp that we had gone to, my friend @PERSON1 was driving home and I sat behind him and I messed with him so much. I had turned my phone up onto its highest volume and played a scary ring-tone and I scared him and maid him jump. @CAPS7 I had licked my finger and put @CAPS8 inside his ear @CAPS7 he freaked out, because he thought @CAPS8 was really gross. After that he had his window open and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @CAPS7 we had stopped by the store in some small town and god some soda and I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I Said: ""@CAPS6't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha."" @CAPS7 I took a drink of my soda and as I took the drink I started laughing again and some of my soda went up into my nose @CAPS7 I said: ""@CAPS8 burns so bad. My nose is burning."" All of us where laughing. The ironic part was that like thirty minutes after i had said that we got pulled over. We where driving down the highway and my friend @PERSON1 who was driving thought that the speed limit was sixty-five miles-per-hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy-five. I was gonna try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could lighten him up a little, but my friend @PERSON1 said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot. He looked at the license plate and @CAPS7 turned and asked @PERSON1 if they where @LOCATION1 plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION1. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @CAPS8 was hilarious. The cop was really dumb. I @CAPS6't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing.

568,1,"Computers they give you @CAPS1 and reasearch from a for distance from you. But is it good for you? Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe they @MONTH1 be correct. I believe that a computer can be used by finding things out from far distances, it can also give hand - eye coordination, I also believe that it is ok to use a computer if you are just using it for reasearch or other needed actions. When useing a computer it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far away places. This is good because some people have intrest in places around the world. Also, @CAPS2 need computers now adays, thier teachers give the write up typed assignments, or power point presentations. Also, parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how. Also, some say using a computer can give you Hand eye coordination. Well, it does in fact when you type. Some @MONTH1 not know this hut typing is a skill, some people type fast some type slow and some are average typers. Also, to teach little kids maybe even some adults, people have created a typing game on the computer it will teach kids how to type. Also, some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute. People naturally type about thirty words a minute. I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research. Many kids have learned about these other websites such as facebook, I tunes, youtube, and twitter. Some become addictted so they never got off. Also, being on all of these websites and more try to give you things. that my give you a virus. Viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of pop-ups to your monitor. I feel that it is ok to go on the computer to do research or bok vacations. If you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse. Over all I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy. Computer have a positive effect on people.

To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith decided to create a ""mooring mast"" where dirigibles could land and become ""transportation of the future."" However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like New York City. Another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than down the streets. If the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control. Finally, it is illegal to have a airships flying too low to the ground and near people.

Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours!

513,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living.",4,4,8,6.0

Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting. Many people see many different things.      Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standerds are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word.     If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it.

21203,8,"         The @CAPS1 and Benefits of @CAPS2 is really an important thing in life. Laughter lightens mood and makes you feel more happy. If people laugh more often their days are more happier, lighter and much more shorter. Little children are the ones who laugh more often. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious. There are a lot of stories that laughter is the important element. Laughter can connect with many other nice elements, such as being glad or happy. I have once read a story about a little girl named @CAPS3 who liked to make people glad. And through gladness, people were made to laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick people became healthier and stopped being sick. Laughter consists of many different factors. For example, being glad leads to laughing more, being happy, and of course smiling more. When you are felling down and some stranger for example smiles to you, you feel happier and maybe your mood is going to lighten. The morning dawned to be gray and rainy. The people of the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything was going up-side down. No one was smiling. The breakfast was a very monotonous one, because no one felt like talking. It seemed that the day is going to end like this.  @CAPS4 was also very grumpy this day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad at rain. Rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was mad at her maid because she has forgotten to fill her pitcher with warm water, as she always did. She was mad at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she has not even thought that if she had been more happier today, then everything will seem okay. Well, so, she still had to go to school, wanted she or not.  At school, the little teacher was merry as usual. She wasn't a bit grumpy, even if it was a rainy and gloomy day. Some of the student had the same mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. The school work seemed endless to @CAPS4, especially her mathematics. But everything changed after the teacher has told everyone that it was story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives. But she wasn't at all affected by their moods. She was very simple and always happy. Over a period of time, the people she was visiting (especially the sick and old) begin to be happy, just like her. And when she had to go away from that village, everyone was sad to see her go. With lightness of heart and being happy, the girl has left the most precious gift, being always happy which led to laughter more often. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger might always hear happiness and laughter. And it was even enjoyable to stay in that place a little while before continuing your journey. Because the passer-by's always felt themselves feeling much better in health, because of laughing. After the teacher has finished the story, @CAPS4 thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer her family up? Even though it was raining, it didn't mean that everyone should be gloomy. So after the school was finished, @CAPS4 ran home to cheer everyone up. In the @TIME1, when everyone was finished with their day's tasks and relaxing, there was laughter heard through the windows. Seems like @CAPS4 has found a way to lead laughter into her household too. The story she had heard earlier in the day has helped her today, and all through her long life. She has remembered this special rule of home happiness. And always in her home there was happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days. We can see that this small factor, which doesn't seem to big @CAPS1 to us has made @CAPS4's life more happy. I hope that this little factor can help you too.",19,20,40,6.666666666666667

The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it's just some things, people might take offense to. That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves.     I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive.     Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say. It's not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level. You don't have to subscirbe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways. What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny.You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shlef because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyones' wants and needs.     I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books. It'd be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books?     I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offenesive. Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf everytime someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, you'd be left with nothing.",4,4,4,6.0

15561,6,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Lüsted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lüsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful.",3,4,4,10.0

1422,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us.",3,5,8,6.0
15610,6,"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire state building. The architects knew that the large mooring mass could not be simply placed on the building flat roof.

Because, the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arrose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fir at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because, the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher. Helium is more flammable. Lüsted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Lüsted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an impractical location for an airship dock.

What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.

4143,2,"As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some @MONTH1 be eye oppening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing.

4305,2,"Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books. That isnt the only choice they are faced with either. There is music and magazines too. Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books,  biographies, autobiographies, etc. On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles. Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate. But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive. Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions.      There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves. The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and @MONTH1 need it for something they are doing. People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book @MONTH1 be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book.      This problem is similar to others around the world. For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or @MONTH1 find offensive due to the items they sell. That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall. Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library.     A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music. After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library. This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier.      I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects. I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies. And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc. Some people @MONTH1 find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing.

A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries.     A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?     There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.      Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem @CAPS8. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.     You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore",4,4,4,6.0

21491,8," Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it and I have gave my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It maybe be hard to not be an effect of the worlds chaos and daily epidemic but doesn't seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown. To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen just to be care free, I would consider it exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of tranquility.   My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my position . I long for that purity I once had, as most do. It was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high heal shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possible hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a pick-nick under my favorite long green haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for. It's a fragile youth of a child. As life goes on my purity has faded and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended till I felt alone in sol om. I had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times. I felt god had betray me if not hated me. I then had became a stone cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror I no longer seen a @CAPS3 for life just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective. My strong hatred for the world was begin to handicap me in various if not most important aspect. If couldn't open up to myself - how could I open up to the world? To @CAPS3, to learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself I learned the most important lesson; laughter and wiliness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove. Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a reoccurring symptom that take pride in everyday. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows I still manage to scrap up a smile. Helping people helped me realize and understand this is passion of mine. I want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest darkest caves, their is always a rock awaiting to crumb to bring light. To me their is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light -- a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that re-leaving feeling that everything will be all right. so I live me life through a gracious smile. In my perspective if you create a smile and you will receive three more. This is my motto,"" @CAPS3 life for what it's new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn as life rolls on.""",15,15,30,5.0

4682,2,"Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today. Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences. However, many do not. All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them.     If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults. Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way. Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate. Those who borrow anything at the library @MONTH1 have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge. By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them.     Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most. There are still the majority, however, who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials. Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but, from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect.

They have censored movies just sitting there.     I even go through the shelfves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldnt even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they dont see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I dont think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children aare able to look at them. Thats not right at all.     Far as the music i agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldnt know how to respond to a song thats talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I dont feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.         I dont believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldnt be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents.They dont need to grow up fast they need to enjoy there life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all.      Inconclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things.

The @ORGANIZATION1 did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the @ORGANIZATION1. They knew that @CAPS6 could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everying. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have not personality at all.

Even though some people @MONTH1 believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers do have a positive effect on us.

Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If yes, didn't you have to, write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back. If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response back within days. I know many parents and other adults @MONTH1 think that e-mails are a waste of energy but actually they're faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Yes? No? That's where computers come in. It's much more interesting to use the internet than reading from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all of the facts that they've learned from that one book but various students learn differently than that. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember it because they won't be put to sleep by the boredom of a textbook. Many people have mentioned and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't I understand that you are a person who likes to keep up with the current events so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean @CAPS2.

The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read!         I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it. but in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read. I hope understand through my point of view     All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people havent gotten to the reading stage yet.

1736,1,"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.",6,5,11,9.0

People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good.",4,4,8,6.0

We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers.

When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone.

3249,2,"There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books.  This is called censorship.  However @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library.  @CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good?  This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books.  Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons;  The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in  all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.       First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press.  This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today.  If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations.  Children @MONTH1 read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author.  If so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves.  It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer.      When it comes to the arugements of @CAPS3 to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds.  This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything.  Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it.  No matter the age they are.  If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning.       A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember.  This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this.  Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years.  When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more.  Now someone can come along and say:  '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'.  It's no different.  The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge.  An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease.  It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?     All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public.  There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap.  Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law.  If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books.  It would be a scary day if that happened.  For it would not be something that went well in our history.  Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings.  So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them.

Then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @DATE1 we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing that she says to us is. CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. Then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @CAPS1 is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However some dirigibles attempted to dock.

1212,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One @MONEY1 the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook.Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper. When you are typing a paper, you don't have to worry about @CAPS1 handwriting or breaking your pencil. You also don't have to worry abut spelling something wrong because computers can check you spelling and grammar. What you are writting a paper you have in about all @MONEY1 these problems and more. You also have to spend money on pencils and other writting suppplies. Computers also saved people @MONEY1 becase they didn't need to buy paper to make textbooks. Computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other. Before computers were invented, you couldn't talk to people in other countries unless you paid to use a phone or sent them mail. Now, you can send instant mail which saves days @MONEY1 time and paper. You can also use webcams to talk to family members and people you don't know. That can save you a lot @MONEY1 money because you don't have to pay money for postage stamps, phone calls, or plane rides to visit them. Those are some @MONEY1 the best reasons why @CAPS1 a home computer is better than not @CAPS1 one. A home computer can save you time when you want to research a country, person, or culture. They can save you money because you don't have to buy postage stamps, pay for phone calls, or pay for plane rides to visit someone from a different state or country. Computers also help save paper because you no longer need to make large textbooks or use a different price @MONEY1 paper when you make a writting mistake.",5,4,9,7.0

A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS8 his ""stunna-shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS8 frustration, he didn't want me crying.

""@CAPS8 you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed aloud, I couldn't help @CAPS2.

""@CAPS7 you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" @PERSON3 smiled even greater.  The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but @CAPS2 overflowed with laughter.

Another big issue is that people are over useing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the useige of your computer that wont be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to pot so called ""down payments"" on computers, something like a but you pay each month and setting up internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes there are good and bad things talked about computers but without them we wouldn't have a modern era. Then controll the robot that makes your to the that saves lifes so with all this said I would lie to say thanks or listening and go computers!",5,4,9,7.0
16165,6,"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe.",2,2,2,5.0
21025,8,"                                  Friendship and Laughter go @CAPS1 in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 best friend and I would spend hours sitting on her bed laughing at nothing. We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So i said goodbye. @CAPS3 best friends name is @CAPS4, we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight were I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS3 life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself ""your not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her"", like subconsciously i didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked nonstop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Sense then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her's because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS3 best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose that again. So everyday I'm going to make sure that we laugh as much as possible and I'm never going to take our friendship for granted again.",18,22,40,6.666666666666667

430,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers effect people, well I dont agree with that statement. Here are my @NUM1 reasons why. Computers and other technology make the way easier. Talking to family and friends without spending money. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop @CAPS4 cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. @CAPS4 example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items @CAPS4 a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @NUM2 hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email @CAPS4 free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, myspace, yahoo, and even ohvoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat @CAPS4 free. All of those sites you can text @CAPS4 free and touch those with your @CAPS4 example, one day I didn't want spend my to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them. And it was @NUM3 times better and free and better. Even @CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars @CAPS4 a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @CAPS4 it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then @MONTH1 be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited @CAPS4 the computer @NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night. An @NUM3:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you @CAPS4 having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends @CAPS4 free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine. Thanks again.",4,4,8,6.0

Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.

He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love.""

In addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life. In a way computer privliges can be as like your enjoying life. Say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam, video messaging and more. That's life well what im trying to say is that yall can talk see each other, have private conversations. Computer's dont alway take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you, you can take school, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success to some people. Only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer what would you do? How can you survive? For example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school. How would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they thought and knew we was going to get so excited about how cool our computers' are they shouldnt so much new technologies in our life.

4289,2,"As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details?    I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it.     Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense?

Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas.

If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below.

It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area.

They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. @DATE1 is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not.     I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above. I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are ? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age.     In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version.     Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them.     Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1 will find a way to see @DATE1 stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally.

16036,6,"The obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.",3,2,3,7.5

While designing the mast the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on to the Empire State building as this would add stress to the buildings fram. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties.",3,3,3,7.5

For the same reasons, safety stop education, sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people @MONTH1 think how come using a computer is not safe. Well eventhough you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer what you do over computer is not safe. The reason why is because most of the time there would be thats thirty and we be like @NUM1, @DATE1 and I use those ages because kids are age be the man one on @CAPS2 myspace, but he can be like thirty and we be like @NUM1 - @DATE1 and us not knowing he comes on myspace or @CAPS2 put another picture up there of young did we start thinking to him meet up and something had happend. For example my friend who was on myspace was talking to a fourty-one year old and then they met up but she did not know his age and she was rapped. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important even for adults and children. Bieng on the computer is not going to bring are education up is going to brings down. The reason why this is most @DATE1 threw @NUM3 come home from school put there hookbag down eat and then do straight on myspace, @CAPS2, @CAPS5 instead of studying, reading, doing their homework. Eventhough those websites do help you learn but only about for myspace, read messages on @CAPS2 look at people comments on @CAPS5.

21563,8," The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come.",21,25,46,7.666666666666667

I feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. It teaches us about everything & everything.

For example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows @PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live eaach & every. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them. Those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters.

For example I had to research a person my project & all I dis was type in his name & pages full of information popped. You will be amazal how much information the computer has.

Talking online is very fun. I mean you in many website, myspace, facebook, twitter. Its never ending. People can talk to old friends, family anybody really. But many people have to be careful cause their creeps out ther. Like say you can't meet up with you friend you can @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo (webcame) them. The computer is you friend.

21315,8,"Laughter: A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows @MONTH1 be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships. Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""; instances of laughter are @CAPS1 anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.  In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a @CAPS1 action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people. Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together.  Laughter is a @CAPS1 action that ""personifies"" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the @CAPS1 language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people.",20,15,35,5.833333333333333

479,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits.

I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade and she said, ""@CAPS3 class inastly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer. That is really the only reason we don't do @CAPS1."" @CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @CAPS1. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading ""@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising,"" Exercising and going outside is a very important things to do but people cannot do @CAPS1 if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'

She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age.

Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, @CAPS5 @MONTH1 pop up.

For instance, they wanted to add more hight to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream"" @PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.""

Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself.

I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or @CAPS1.      My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs. I do not that think books, magazines or @CAPS1 shoulds have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that peice of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that @CAPS3.       One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center contains inapropriate books, magazines or moviees, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material. This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners. I also think that books and other peices of media of such inapropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content.     If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing; I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that @MONTH1 not know about its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed.

3252,2,"The contents of the books in libraries vary in many way. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies. A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie.     In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies. There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.      With the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to. But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @CAPS1 that they like.When freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading. Doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?     In my experience of topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers.

3570,2,"Each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library.  Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide.  Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting.  There will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious.  Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors.  People should maintain a right to choose which books he or she @MONTH1 want to read.     Never, will one book bind the world.  Minds of human beings are too complexly separated.  For example; reading '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON2 in my @CAPS3 class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class.  Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's.  Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done.  There will always be that one person who declines to agree.     It is a choice.  It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read.  If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom?  Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the @CAPS4 faith will not be stood for by the reader.  Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point.  To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story.  A choice should remain a person's right; especially to read a book written to be read.     Finding an appropriate book is not the problem.  That has yet to become the problem.  The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling.  I find '@CAPS5 in the @CAPS6' to be dangerously inappropriate.  However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions.  Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content.  Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive.  There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it.  To reiterate, the mind of human is a unique one, that identifies with no other.     To sum up the full idea of this position; every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires.  Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down.  Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it; sometimes completely rebelliously.  Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf everytime someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone.  As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice.  Every human mind desires the freedom to choose.  Give people the choice. Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they @MONTH1 be interested in.  Let readers have their freedom.",5,6,5,8.0
15508,6,"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.

For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.

When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example people could google each quakes and learn all about the people that has lost their life's. The people that they will donate some money to the poor. Children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to the beutiful birds and animal. In their the world, They will be able to do this on computer. The might be so more this lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get.

If you let @MONTH1 periods of time then @CAPS1 will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball.

There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day @DATE3, give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them. Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have e healing. This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there. One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @DATE1 and we it came to be @DATE2 and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but just as every other person she must have been sick so that's what we thought except she missed another day and then another, and another, so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back, but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she wasn't the same she wasn't laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different. I thought to myself ""what is wrong with her?"" i finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had past away i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she didn't have her mom anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she doesn't i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life.

One obstacle involved dropping ""A mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). If they had done this, the mask would have added a great amount of stress to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened but this was too costly. Another obstacle the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if a dirigible had accidently caught on fire, a great amount of damage could be caused. However, the greatest obstacle involved the harsh wind current on top of the Empire State Building. Even if the dirigible was ""Tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (paragraph @NUM2). The use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible down while ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). In conclusion, while building the mast on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders faced many obstacles.",4,3,4,10.0

21514,8," I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house.

21321,8," My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.",20,18,40,6.666666666666667

I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before.

16399,6,"In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature.

350,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagine a world without computers? Well I @CAPS1't because I think computers are great. First of all if you have a computer you @CAPS1 meet new people. Second you @CAPS1 do projects on them or homework if you need to. Lastly in a computer you @CAPS1 basically find out anything you want to know. Read ahead and discover why I think computers are great. Who doesn't like meeting new people, because I do. If you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who go to your school and you might not now you @CAPS1 look them up on your computer. Also if you had nobody to talk to one time you @CAPS1 go on the computer and try to meet new people. I know I do that all the time. Lastly it doesn't hurt anymore to make friends or talk to people online. it's actually fun once you try it. So that's why I think one reason that computers are great is because of the people you meet. Second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer @CAPS1 help. My science teacher always wants assignments printed and how @CAPS1 I do that with out a computer. Also if one day you forgot your homwork or any assignments just ask a friend online of if you have a school website look on it. Therefore computers are great because all assignments look ,better when they are printed. My last reason is because on a computer you @CAPS1 pretty much look for anything. For example, say you wanted to find a place to go to and you didn't have a adress or anything, you @CAPS1 always check on the computer. Also if their is a problem or something with you house, car, bills, or anything you @CAPS1 always see if you @CAPS1 get any hekp on internet. Lastly if you wanted to buy anything and you could't find it any stare you @CAPS1 just get it online. So basically like I said you @CAPS1 do anything. In conclusion I think omputers have a great effect on life. First you @CAPS1 meet how people or friends. Second you @CAPS1 do projects or homework. Lastly you @CAPS1 basically do anything on a computer. So that's why I think computers are great and they @CAPS1 help alot in life instead of hurting anyone.",4,4,8,6.0

I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library.     I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material.

I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults.     I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them.

That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.

Do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives? Hand-eye coordination is not something you are born with. You gain it as you get older and acheive practive. Computers help with this goal.

Did you know, according to ""Time"" magazine, that people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, such as schoolwork, because it enables your hands and eyes to work together as one?

I have cheerleading everyday after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours and hours to look in books and find out what I need to know. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places. It is faster and more accurate.

It's very hard to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! With a computer you could send messages and photo's to interact with them. You wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. You could also meet new people. Get new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from all different race and culture.

107,1,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there @CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks/changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you @MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did.",5,5,10,8.0

We can make something funny out of pretty much anything. I think being able to laugh, and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic.  I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of @CAPS4 friend @LOCATION1. She is by far one of the funniest people I have ever met in @CAPS4 entire life. Though she is extremely funny, she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. She asks questions after people already tell her the answer, she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her, and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice. The things she does @MONTH1 not be super intelligent sometimes, but they sure can give anyone a good laugh.  I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with @LOCATION1 on the way to volleyball practice, and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word. At the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried. By the time we got to practice her and I had been laughing for about ten minuets straight. During practice our @CAPS3 had been explaining directions to one of the drills. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five @CAPS2. @LOCATION1 not fully understanding the directions, decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her. So she put her hand up and asked, ""@CAPS3, so do we @CAPS2 serve to spots one and five?"" @CAPS4 whole team broke out into hysterical laughter. @LOCATION1 who didn't understand stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in. That happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice. She even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her. By the time practice was over I think we had gotten a better workout from laughing then from playing volleyball. On our way out to the car, @LOCATION1 decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car. @CAPS5 agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win in @LOCATION1's face, and all of a sudden they were no where to be found. I ran up the stairs to see who had won, @CAPS2 to find @LOCATION1 face down on the ground with @CAPS5 sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but to laugh. We sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes, and we laughed about it all the way home. That was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days I have ever had. I will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together. I think @LOCATION1 and I being able to laugh so much together brings us closer as friends because even if we get irritated with each other, or something bad happens, we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end, and that is something every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always make everything better, but it can bring @CAPS1 so someones day, and you never know the positive effect a little laugh can have on even the grumpiest of people.

It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache.

For children who are old enough to use / work a computer, they'@CAPS1 be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most @ORGANIZATION1 the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could help small buisnesses too.

Mac. magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people become obese and have vitamind @CAPS1 deficiancy from using their computers so much. When using your computer you could be working out or exercising, and this causes obesity.

In conclusion, it is safe to say, that computers do not benefit society today. Many people have an addiction to technology, you could be using your time more wisely, and computers put your health at risk.

People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some websites that allow you to do so are myspace, facebook, and @ORGANIZATION1. With facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is relly quite easy. Also, with @ORGANIZATION1 you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have @ORGANIZATION1 and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer I can interact with them all year round. Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle.

While he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time both father and son dip their cokie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh.

You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games. Such as how many points @PERSON1 got for your fantasy team.

I mean sure you can pick up a book, but why? with a computer you can quickly, and easily type in what you need to know and within seconeds you have @NUM1 million sites that can tell you what you need to know.

Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.",4,4,4,6.0

21036,8," My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and are there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS1's best quality is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4's, an all girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of continuing on to @ORGANIZATION1 like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION2, I could feel that something was missing. @CAPS1. Without her cackling laugh ringing down the hallways, it felt oddly quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to ""shush"" a fair amount too. Our little brick @CAPS3 church!  Most @DATE1's, I stood up on the alter with the priest and helped him prepare the bread and such. And most @DATE1's, my best friend @CAPS1 was in the pews. One particular @DATE1 I will never forget, @CAPS1 thought it would be funny to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me all throughout the mass. See @CAPS1, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually and up with tears in my eyes. I was standing up in front of the whole congregation and was using every ounce of self control I had not to bust out laughing. The congregation must have thought I was really being changed by the @CAPS8 because I had the biggest smile on my face.  I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it feels like it is physically impossible to stop laughing. You have to bite you lip, think about something sad, or try breathing excercises. Every time I glanced in her direction a new wave of giggles washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mom's direction, her evil eye burned brighter. After what felt like eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bitten my lip so hard that there were ridges indented on the inside of my mouth. Usually after church, we walk over to the @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and doughnuts. We catch up on @ORGANIZATION2, and each others lives now that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously stupid stories of her days, and I always inform her of the latest and greatest gossip from her hometown. But the thing that we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend.  Laughter keeps @CAPS1 and I close. If laughter really does add years to your life, we are probably going to be the two old ladies that live on the hill with twenty cats, and nobody really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she'll laugh and then we'll go play with her cat, @LOCATION2, or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our never-ending inside jokes. When I laugh, it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is at peace in the world. It is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. That's what I feel when I'm laughing with my best friend @CAPS1.    ",21,20,41,6.833333333333333

The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below.

9301,4,"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saengs life and gave her new found courage and strength.

Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had becomealmost familiar to her now. Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  ",3,3,3,10.0

Some experts @CAPS4,""People are spendiong too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family."" @CAPS5 is and was originally invented to keep in touch with family.

Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader.",3,2,3,7.5

21134,8,"                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS4 had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life!

In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and.

Some have never been offended. Some, always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings",4,3,4,6.0

Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than @LOCATION1, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable so if it caught on fire it would go down in a very populated area. Another obstacle was at that height, the wind was very strong and violent. When tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The last obstacle was there was a law stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas this made it impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building.",3,3,3,7.5

You hear them everyday even if you don't want to, but you do.     I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period.

Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around.

15609,6,The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.,3,3,3,7.5

3075,2,"The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into litteral meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person @MONTH1 look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others @MONTH1 not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lieing between the pages. With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed?     Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer @MONTH1 skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person.      Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic. At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Mid way through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks I walked the halls scaared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be seperated from those for younger childeren, because the description in a book @MONTH1 leave a child with emotional scares.     Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book @MONTH1 contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they @MONTH1 be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world alot of harm.     If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, their won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, book worms will be able make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion don't take away the wanders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.",4,5,4,6.0

4758,2,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want. If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent.      For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor.     From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of.     Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life.     So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse.

Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can't. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information!

With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant.

3961,2,"Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else.",4,4,4,6.0

16595,6,"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully.",4,4,4,10.0

14944,6,"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. There needed to be modifications made to make it safe for a dirigible to land there. The biggest obstacle was nature. Lüsted said it best in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The final problem the builders faced was, even if they did manage to figure out a way to put the mooring mast up, there was still a law stating dirigibles illegal to land there. Lüsted said in paragraph @NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."".

4613,2,"To the newspaper edits,Should books, music, movies, magzines, and other reading materials, be removed if the materials are view to be offensive?     I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1 an Author (in the last sentence) said if we remove books from shelfs there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lotts of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people but maybe the readers who get offensive do not understand the materials that they read. For example the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem, maybe the reader who gets offensived about those types of topics just do not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it.      An other reason why could be because we are in america, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. Its fair to say that because well, it is true we has people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offensives them does not mean you can take away the writers material. Doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth. If the reader has the right to say what in on your mind then what is the maining of being free to write what you wish to write. If you can see where I am coming from it takes a lott not to talk to a teacher or someone in a highter postition from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer.     Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because has humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammer, the diffrent styles of writing, or know more about the topic. @CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then @CAPS3 something fun? can not think of anything? well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives.     Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself  and at the world and hates a tape about angles. While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place. Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or leaved out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the librarie's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too.     Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelfs is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likly that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that? it is not reality. And if that could even happening which is unlikly that it would people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there.     I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on.The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up likeing it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not  learn it.",3,4,3,4.0

3596,2,"Should They or Should They @CAPS1?     What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that?     One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to?     There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem.      There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1. Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing.     This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1. Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!!",4,4,4,6.0

These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated @CAPS1.Y.C. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas.",2,2,2,5.0

4687,2,"Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad? Do you think that there are certian books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content? A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or protray bad images of certian social groups.      In @DATE1's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have thier own opinions on how they view different things. To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there. Taking this all into concideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be seperate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults. I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them. In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting.      By saying these things, seperating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at. I also believe that is would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be; then they can see everything that is recommended for them.      From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young. This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them. So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting",4,4,4,6.0

The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, when the snow melts and the geese return, this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, and this hibiscus budding she is saying when everything comes to life and is at its highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence.

According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe.       Last but not @CAPS1, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefor it would be impossible for a ship to land there.",4,3,4,10.0

4382,2,"I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books.  However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. because they will separate be washig some bad things and they will be a bad idea",2,2,2,2.0
4433,2,"Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'.

4652,2,"Censorship to most people means much more than the average @NUM1 syllable word. It means giving up the right to say and think however you want. To most, this idea is not a good one. When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of @CAPS3. In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries.     One reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of @CAPS3. Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was aloud to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As @CAPS1's, it is our right to speak and write however we want without reprocussions, however offensive or non-offensive the material @MONTH1 be. As @CAPS1's all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another. Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? Absolutley not. Freedom of @CAPS3 is our birth right and we should be aloud to say or write anything without being censored.     '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book of the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right. As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive. If that was the case, I could find @NUM2 books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find @NUM3 books that are offensive and so on. Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.'     And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings. As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book. Just recently I read the book @CAPS4 @CAPS5. As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character. Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive. However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into @DATE1's life that I new nothing about. It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use. The book made me reflect on myself and how @NUM4 plus years changes people, @CAPS1's more specifically.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea. When one is censored they give up their right of freedom of @CAPS3, other books in general, and loss of oppotunity to learn new things. Hopefully with this essay, I have persuaded you or at least informed you on the cons of censorship in libraries",4,4,4,6.0

I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way.

3449,2,"Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not. Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs.     People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds.

People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them. Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material. The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them.

He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents.

1146,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my point-of-view, I think that computers are positive and can give a lot of information to us humans. Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much, computers help the world get in touch with relatives and family from arand the world, job findings in different countries and states, and also learning about the whole world. I'm going to explain to you why I think computers are positive for humans. To start off, I would like to say that not everyones families & friends live close by to each other. They @MONTH1 live across the whole other side of the world. This is why we have webcams and chatting on computers. How could anyone expect us to see our family in friends if there is no webcam? Okay yeah we have cell phones but not everyone can afford them. People can go to their hearest library and use the computer there for free! The next reason why I say that computers are important is because when you get tired of fired from yar job, you can't just sit home and expect live in your house for free, you have @CAPS1 find another job. You can sign up for jobs right on your computer. How much easier could it get? Now you don't have to borrow your mom's car to go to the interview. Furthermore the last reason I would like to commit is that learning about the world is very important for the young and old. You don't think that every single teacher visited somewhere else and that's how they know about the world? No of course not! Teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject. For me I like to learn a bout crocodiles in @LOCATION1. I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. Do you really think I would go all the way of @LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can just turn the computer on and get-lost in the crocodile world? No of course not. It would be fun though to traver to @LOCATION1 to see that but I don't have that kind of money. To sum all this up, I think you can see my part of the argument.

20825,8," In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible.

I do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons.      As i have menioned I do feel that everyting should be allowed because is could be needed by someone for person infomation, or a classroom prompt that needs infomation. But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirments as to what is apportiate and what is not. If that person has a legitament reason for needed something i don't see the harm of them getting what they need",3,3,3,4.0

Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable.

You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating. Not to forget that it is more entertaning. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more proffesional, You can copy and paste your images that you can @CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremly neat, @CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or mabe, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benifit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convinience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interupt you can pause the video too. This is more efficie, they care I very convinient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or.

With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier. Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate, others @MONTH1 disagree. That's why creating a rating system would be best.     With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed.      I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal. What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage'?

I will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills, how they give information to people, and how they allow us to socialize. Over ninety four percent of people today own a computer ad feel as though they have learned many things from it. I bet you didn't know that! First off I will be telling you about how computers help people type. The @CAPS2 on a computer doesn't go alphabetically. This means that you have to practice more to get better in typing. I remember the first time I tried to use the @CAPS2 it difficult but as I tried more I got better. Once I got better I realize where the keys were and soon I don't even have to look up the computer and all of it's parts help people by teaching them skills that they @MONTH1 used in the. These skills @MONTH1 be needed in their job field. Computers are helpful device. The next thing I will be telling you about is how computers have information that is useful to and its where a child is working know a lot about the. It holds information and has website when the internet they. The computer. My final reason why computers have good effect. If you need to talk to a friend but dont feel like calling them you can just go on to a website and chat with them. There are so many that you just can't choose! Did you know what they are over one million of these kinds of websites? There is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 just to name a few. This also gives people the chance to socialize with people from all over the world. This in return causes people to have better social skills. Maybe they will become ore friendly and become more outgoing.

855,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live.

1160,1,"Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music.

4417,2,"In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @CAPS1 are opposed to. While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be.     One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library.     A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @CAPS5 same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library.     Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials.     These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. Today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable. While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often",5,5,5,8.0

You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also  in your everyday life.      One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it.     Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read.     I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture.

A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable.

For example, when she said, When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, Ive seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   ",2,2,2,6.666666666666667

Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.,1,1,1,3.333333333333333

I observed the way @CAPS7 glared at @CAPS27 in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. ""@CAPS2 huh,"" my cousin, @PERSON1, asked while staring at @CAPS3, who was, of course, the new girl. I glanced over at @CAPS3 and then back at @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS5 on! @CAPS11 can say @CAPS26! @CAPS7 can't hear us,"" @CAPS7 whispered. @PERSON1's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as @CAPS7 thought. @CAPS3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, @CAPS7 seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS26's possible, @CAPS7 has been the talk of the whole @NUM1 grade class since @CAPS7 arrived about @NUM2 days ago. ""@CAPS6 hello! Taylor? Are @CAPS11 there?"" @CAPS7 was now in my face and view of @CAPS3.  ""@CAPS7 does look @CAPS2 on the outside, but maybe @CAPS7 is actually a nice person,"" is @CAPS1 I said, but I knew @CAPS15 would not satisfy @PERSON1 at all. ""@CAPS1? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. @CAPS7 gives off that type of aura."" ""@CAPS11 shouldn't judge someone @CAPS31 their looks,"" I responded. @PERSON1 gave me @CAPS15 sort of confusing look. ""I mean, @CAPS11 never know unless @CAPS11 ask.""  ""@CAPS12 if your such the expert on @CAPS26 why don't @CAPS11 go sit with her at lunch, and ask her."" @CAPS13 man. There was @CAPS29 way I could possibly do that. I know I @CAPS24 said not to judge someone @CAPS31 their appearance, but @CAPS7 looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her @CAPS7 will kick me in the shins. @CAPS1 a predicament @CAPS15 is. ""@CAPS14't @CAPS11 the one who wants to get to know her? @CAPS11 ask."" @CAPS15 one won't @CAPS31 past @PERSON1 either. ""@CAPS16? @CAPS29 way. We already decided @CAPS11 were going to ask. @CAPS11 can't @CAPS5 back with the same thing,"" @CAPS7 argued. @PERSON1 is a very stubborn girl, and though @CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @CAPS7 really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior @CAPS7 has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy.  ""@CAPS17,"" I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS29 matter @CAPS1 I say, I am going to have to face @CAPS3.  ""That's @CAPS1 I thought. @CAPS26's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am @CAPS24 helping @CAPS11 out."" @CAPS7 had @CAPS15 mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at @CAPS3 one last time, and then at the clock. @CAPS26 was @NUM3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at @NUM4.  I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe @CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @CAPS7 is actually nice, and people are @CAPS24 misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know @CAPS1 to say; I can't @CAPS24 casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say ""@CAPS21. How are @CAPS11?"" The impossible is @CAPS24 impossible and people should @CAPS24 except @CAPS26, in fact @CAPS26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, @CAPS26 was now @NUM5 and still ticking. ""@NUM6 minutes,"" @PERSON1 said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. ""@CAPS22? I kept watching @CAPS11 during class. Looked like @CAPS11 were going to jump through that window and run away at any second."" @CAPS7 laughed. My seat was @CAPS31 the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. ""I have @CAPS29 clue @CAPS1 I am going to say,"" I finally said.  ""@CAPS24 say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or @CAPS1 @CAPS7 likes. Talk about school even,"" @CAPS7 replied. ""@CAPS26's time. Go."" @CAPS27 piled out of the class room and in to the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table @CAPS3 was at; @CAPS29 one was around her, @CAPS29 surprise there.  ""@CAPS6, @MONTH1 I sit here,"" I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at @CAPS1 @CAPS7 said. ""@CAPS31 all means, go ahead,"" @CAPS7 smiled. Wow, @CAPS7 is really cute when @CAPS7 smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation @CAPS31 introducing myself and asking how @CAPS7 was and how @CAPS7 liked @CAPS15 school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. @CAPS7 was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together.  After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is @CAPS24 so nostalgic, @CAPS26's almost indescribable. @CAPS24 something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life.",20,20,40,6.666666666666667

15970,6,"The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there.",3,4,4,10.0

4502,2,"What is offensive in libraries?  The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non-censored books, music, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries.  These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves.  They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writting.     From my own experience, I have seen innapropriate movies.  To me, I feel that they teach me some lessons, but, it also depends on what type of movie it is.  If it is rated @CAPS1 then I know that I @MONTH1 see some blood, gory scenes, and nudity.  If this type of movie is not @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then I know that some of this stuff on the screen @MONTH1 happen in real life.  Most @MONTH1 not happen, but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world.  All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at.     In libraries, there should not be nudity websites, books, or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and innapropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library.  Now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it, then it should stay on the shelves.  I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing.     So, as I ask again, what @MONTH1 be offensive in libraries?  Some @MONTH1 say that books, magazines, movies etc. with racial slurs are offensive; but to others, it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be.  In my perspective, I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over.  That @MONTH1 be it, it @MONTH1 not.

In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place.",3,3,3,4.0

One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank.

The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down.

15291,6,"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ended up with big obstacles in reaching that goal.

The mooring mast goal was really starting to be dowstable when one problem wasn't realized. Safty, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of oxygen, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flamable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"", was the greatest obstacle, as Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast.

Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech.     Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want. It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see.     Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better?     I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway.      That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive.      We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it.

Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life.

When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.

Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plance crashed that you mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it. One thing that I find great is that you can watch tv. and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high priced chanles to watch movies.

Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you sad because your dog died. You just can use the internet for just about anything. Lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend @MONEY1 on an album, you can now just buy a single song for a dollar.

4510,2,"I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed.     Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools",4,4,4,6.0

In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades.

'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..'

565,1,"Dear Newspaper, The world that we live in today is full of technology. Everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time. The technology has many great things about it, but theres also a huge down fall. The most common technolgy device is the computer, its a great thing to have but its also very bad. The computer can be used to bully, it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammer skills. We all know the websites such as facebook, myspace and @CAPS1. They sseem harmless but its really just a place for harassment. Their said to keep friends in touch, butkids use them to say hurtful things about each other. Half the kids in my eighth grede class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids @MONTH1 say they don't spend to much time on their computers but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing hey do before going to sleep at night. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child. I've seen many kids gain exessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food they don't exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers. kids are even getting portable computers, thats how addicted they are. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to inneract with friends, and socialize. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammer. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet thant face to face, and half the time they don't even spell word correct or use proper grammer. In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e-mail your job. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth it. We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts. Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to loose your social and grammer skill? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind.",5,4,9,7.0
3409,2,"Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain veiw set aside for the reader or veiwer at hand. If someone has a different veiw of the text then they should not even be reading or veiwing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different veiws to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work. To have movies band from the public because they are offencive is something that is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we here. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone.     Books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social veiws on something should not be discriminated because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the the people. In novels just because someone uses profainty does not mean that there message is any less clear. Their message @MONTH1 be that profanity is used to offten or that the way that the next generation below them my turn for the worst but it is not used to harm.      Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them @MONTH1 beleive that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express.      In movies you see someone get shot, bruitlly murderd or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violance shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severly injure another person although that is how people perseive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something.      To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something.  Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banded just because they show individuallity; just because they have the deacensy to show us the truth in all the lies told to us but a higher person. These people most likely beleive that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth.

581,1,"Are computers benefiting society? I believe that computers are actually not benifiting society. In this article I will explain how you will recieve less time exersising, less time with your family and friends, and less time enjoying nature just by being on you computers to much. If you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can? Well, think of it this way. You spend so much time on the computer that you recieve little or no exercise! Everyone needs to recieve a little bit of exercise in order to fit and healthy. Our country's obesity level has gone up since our high-tech computers have come out. I believe that this is one main reasons of obesity. This is a major concern in our high-tech, computer society today. Besides you recieving less exercise, you will also recieve less time with your family and friends. I understand with your family could talk to them on facebook but you need interaction by talking face to face. This is one of our basic needs as an individual. Your family is going to be by your side no matter what. But you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you. This is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them. The same thing goes for friends. This is another nacessity for basic needs!!!! Everyone should have some relationship. Lastly, everyone needs to enjoy nature! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to expirence. Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do. The beauties of nature are amanding everybody but @NUM1 of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. You need to sook up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life changing look around nature. But @CAPS1 of this will happen if you stay on your computer @NUM2.

There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get.      The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is.      The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die.      Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring.

We would make fun of each other we would never stop laughing it was some great times when I was with him but he still try's to keep a smile on my face even if I'm mad sad or not in the mood of doing something that's why we need laughter in our life's because it brings joy to does people that love us and care for us and by us having a smile in our face @CAPS6 are happy. Always make a relationship good by having a good time and making each other laugh one way or another it doesn't matter of @CAPS3 you laugh the thing is that you have fun.  Another way to have fun and enjoy your relationship and friends at the same time is to have a time and maybe go to the movies with all your friends and boyfriend and go watch a movie or go to the fair were ever you think you want to go but also think about your friends and boyfriend if @CAPS6 are going to have fun there or if @CAPS6 will get bored. When you go with them make sure you make them laugh at least so @CAPS6 know that you are having fun make up a joke but don't say a joke that will make them fall asleep like my little sister @CAPS4 told us a joke it goes like this (guy on the @NUM3 I speak to your dad?"" the little boy whisper and said ""@CAPS2 busy!"",""@CAPS3 about your mom?"" said the man on the phone, @CAPS5 the kid said ""@CAPS4 is busy too!"" @CAPS5 the man asked him ""@CAPS5 @CAPS3 are @CAPS6 doing?"" and the boy says""@CAPS6 are looking for me!"" we didn't get it at first @CAPS5 my sister told us that the boy was hiding from @CAPS2 parents because he took the phone with him as in the boy don't tell jokes like does make it more funner. and thats why we need laughter in our life's.

15408,6,"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add to much stress to the buildings framework because of a combination of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 foot structure. To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it.

1078,1,"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours!

The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college.

Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents.

4629,2,"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive. Books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes. Not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too.     Personally I like to read books that interest me, as i can assume most do everyone else. Generally to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. I realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but I consider myself a good kid now and I am not negatively affected by those books I read. When I was a kid in @NUM1 grade, I read a book far beyond what most @NUM1 graders read. This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very interesting book! I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessable because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion.     Many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedia's are used for informational purposes. These books can also be accessed by children. I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. Does that make it jusitifiable to remove? Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. When I was a freshman in high school, my @CAPS1 teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students. Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth.      If you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about their's. The same idea can go with any topic in the world today. Somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite. This is the issue with taking books off the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interperte them differently. So if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no point! If someone shouldn't read that book then they shouldn't be allowed. The answer is as simple as that.     When it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf. Most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with. There is only one answer to this question of: Should the library be censored? The answer is no, just let it be. The book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it.

Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more!

In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.

However it was hard to make that happen because it was above civilians and if it ever dropped the resolt would be extremely serious. The second obstacle that got in their way was the wind pressure. It would of caused an un reliable support of the mast which would screw up the docking of the dirigible. Finally the dirigible is the last peice to the puzzle with disaster.

1201,1,"Dear editor, Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the @LOCATION1. Peolple are spending too much time on computers instead of on other activities, an effect not beneficial to society. Because of computers, people have lacked exercise, missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers. According to a survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exrcised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise, would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet @MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example. when I went to @LOCATION2 for a vacation, I learned about the differences in traditions and culture. I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous, eregant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and closs of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use.",6,6,12,10.0
4035,2,"Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1,     Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is a very simple concept. Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there. A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study. I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was something I enjoyed doing. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves?     Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from every being in that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want. That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc.      I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all.

That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips.

Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button.

1287,1,"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit.

Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON1 and I look at each and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS2 grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone.

""@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?"" @PERSON1 asked.  ""@CAPS20 yes it will work!"" I said,""@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?""   ""I guess so ,"" @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  ""@CAPS9 get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!"" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday.

You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.     Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.     Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.     The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either.

4662,2,"When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use the libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school. So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is.     Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insiteful and helpful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse. So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's.     Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war hero's and past events. Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though. Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs. They should be taken off the shelves , put behind the counter; and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask.     Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures. Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine.     So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away. People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either. So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials.",3,4,3,4.0

21626,8," In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS13 story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS4 much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS13 mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS13 mom moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS13 current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS13 mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @CAPS13 laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS1 it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION5, once said ""Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share."" @CAPS1 our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS13 mother and @CAPS11 had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was ""@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" by @PERSON3. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS1 the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS13 mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS8 was a very serious matter. @CAPS13 mom and I went to @CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS4 seriously all the time, @CAPS4 while in @CAPS8 we would start @CAPS15 about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS13 foot, but we would always laugh."" @CAPS10 it or I'll bring @CAPS11 @CAPS12 over here and @CAPS3'll have to take an extra religion class.""@CAPS13 mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say "" @CAPS14 wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS3 started it."" That's who @CAPS13 mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job, and @CAPS4 she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS13 mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON1 ""@CAPS15 is the best calorie burner."" I do believe that and @CAPS13 mom and I see it as that, @CAPS15 is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS4 hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS4 yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever.",17,18,35,5.833333333333333

Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults, but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough. Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it. Everyone has there own tast in reading, as everything else.     Libraries have sections for all ages. With books for there age. Like the childern's section is for little kid, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they'r doing. Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading, watching, or listening to.     The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come. So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want there kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you'r liking. People learn alot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then?

Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'.

Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared"".",4,3,4,10.0

I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us. Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person. We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient. This also means that there are smaller incisions being made, so that means a faster recovery. Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving. Before there were computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no x-rays. Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the opportunity to go to places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the computers it's almost like they have been there.

Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our childrens health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsetion with the technology is making it harder for families to grow moved and of were more succesful in school. The computers are children from a better education.

The electricity that runs computers of this radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in apetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of excersise, and health concerns caused by the computers.

20737,8," Laughter. A story about laughter is what you want to hear? Well my life is filled with laughter and smiling. Crazy I know! If it wasn't for laughing I would not have the six pack that I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh they usually become really close friends maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This one time my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he is so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON1 we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late @DATE1 @TIME1 and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden out of no where he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass he tells me ""@CAPS1 I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!"" @PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe, ""I found it!"" I said. After we found the shoe we realized two hours went by. We were so tired we laid down in the grass to take and break and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was suppose to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why i cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be. I try to be as happy as I can and I try to always make people laugh because laughter is the best way of exercise.",20,20,40,6.666666666666667

'@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple.     Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad.     Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents.     Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them.

His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out.     People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago.     Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened.

They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library. But, nowadays it's computers. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet, plus its much faster and easier to find to find the information you're boking for. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away. It really is magical. Next, using computers saves trees. With a computer we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper. Another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making books. Even students can do their home work, test and quizzes online!

Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world.

For example on some computers a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be help over the computers. Not only is it convienent, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of you expenses. These are simple and save lots of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat! First off, the business software on new computers are out of this world. You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free. Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find you car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated in along with their name, so when you take the taxes to tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for you computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offering access to photosharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who man the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business softwares as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game.

3310,2,"Cooling the @CAPS1: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 From Book @PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.     To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship.     If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it @MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized.

1785,1,My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.,4,4,8,6.0

Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity.",4,4,8,6.0

Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home.

But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

3532,2,"This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive, should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries.     I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then i think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive.     If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued.     Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people.     In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries. Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have",3,3,3,4.0

4414,2,"The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is.",4,4,4,6.0

Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic.

3129,2,"Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too ? Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also? No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.      Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it,well I say we don't.      Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.      I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.      Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item?      A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today.     If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives,have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.      So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things",4,4,4,6.0

4021,2,"If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? In the following I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries.     If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision. Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book.     Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair. Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it. They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves.     I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it. It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there. i also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people.     So all in all I don't think people should be able able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't.

Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship which swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered.",4,4,4,10.0

Computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. Buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running of buisness without a computer. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. Almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. Buisnesses are not the only need for computers. People use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. Thanks to websites like @CAPS2 and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news imediately. Without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. In that case we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. Knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information.

Vielence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight. We already have a high teen vielence rate. Our teen vielence rate really needs to be lowered. When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves.      The movies in my oppion need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight. They see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out. Movies are a bad influnes on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing. Movies could also get kids to be bullies. When a kid is a bullie they don't really know what they are getting themselves into. Another bad example would be drugs and alchoale. Teens and other children get put into peer prushior. When teens and other children have peer prushior its hard to say NO.      The kinds of music people listen to. Music could also be a bad influence on kids. The music that kids listen to would have something about killing, drugs, and alchoale. When kids get involved in drugs and alchoale that will mess up their whole life. For example the screamo music to me sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone.      Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading.

3106,2,"The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.      I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of @NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of @PERSON1, she found a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!     Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure. That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.      Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. They @MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. A @CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!      Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries",4,4,4,6.0

Secondly typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye cordnation. Thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about. Well @CAPS1 do you think?

Also out of the @PERCENT1 of familys that live faraway from each other @PERCENT2 use the computer to comunicate. Hand and eye cordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. Typing on a computer give the great hand and eye cordination. Good hand and eye cordination could be used for many things. For example, playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash. Lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? Well I have. Computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway. For example in the third grade I had to research hammer head sharks. Don't teacher always ask their student to look up a word or a topic on the computer?

3203,2,"I believe that libraries should have more cencorship. Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children should not be exposed to those things yet.     First, I think books that contain violence should be removed. I believe that children are the easiest people to influence. I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. Violence in books can influence killing. Fighting and killing is not good. No young child should be able to check out about full of shooting and fighting. The book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. Reading a book is not worth going to jail for.     Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnacy not being a problem. The reader will think that is what she is suppsed to do which is wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. Those thing @MONTH1 influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. You can atleast sort them all in an adult section.     Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. Drugs make people do things that their right mind don't want them to do. Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite.

The internet is an extreamly useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvient when misused. I'm not saying that its @PERCENT1 nessary for every house to contain one, but that its a luxay most people have. The computer and internet combination is probally one of the most genis ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websights such as myspace and facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a bisnuess or company. Not only that but the internet also makes it possible to purchace clothes online without having to go to the store. I know thats useful for those parents, like many that hate driving to the mall. Second, I can garentuee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessable internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for eduication. These are many websights with a eduicationly purpose only. These are websights like this for children and adults of any age. Many teachers now adays are assinging homework where the internet is nessary. Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that mant teachers would be torn apart without the compluter. Lastly, one of the most important issues. The downsides of the internet.

3210,2,"You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, @CAPS3 all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1. You could blabber in their ear all day about '@CAPS1's responsible to do this and @CAPS3 do this.' and they will go out and do @CAPS1 anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certin things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what @CAPS2 matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork.     If school systems allowed there to be offensive or innapropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say innapropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save @CAPS1 for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is @PERCENT1 of the time @CAPS3 schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals.      School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do @CAPS1 at home. Offensive books should @CAPS3 be there to only distract the teenager from school. @CAPS1's unneccesary. But with public libraries, @CAPS1's a whole new story.     I beleive that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go their on their own free will. I know I personaly go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. @CAPS1's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because @CAPS3 only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. @CAPS1 is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether @CAPS1's just for the heck of @CAPS1 or for school.     @CAPS3 everyone is responsible. Especially @CAPS3 teenagers.

They @MONTH1 use profanity, show naked pictures, or take about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. Also, adults @MONTH1 use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library. So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materialsm such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.     Then, on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off. I say this because if a child does not be experienced to what could happened if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing, or go on watching adult movies. So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age. I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permenantly.      In conclusion, I think that this could go both ways.

3498,2,"In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them.     Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf.     In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books. so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it.     The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library.

1494,1,"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with.",5,5,10,8.0
21214,8,"The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great , because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh , the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places. and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time. The moral of the story that i have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better.

The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.

3268,2,"Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library",3,3,3,4.0

In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him.",2,3,3,7.5

I had moved to @LOCATION1, after @NUM2 weeks went by @CAPS2 parents started going to church, while we was at church I meet some other kid who was about @CAPS2 age. I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS6 hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM1..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS6 wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS2 parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS2 first day in school in @LOCATION1, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS6'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS2 teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said ""here!"" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON1,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS2 class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS6 was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON1 kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS6 liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS6 ""replied yea what bout you?"" I ""told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes"" @CAPS6 said we could play this @DATE1 at church. I told em @CAPS3. later on that day I told @CAPS2 older brother @CAPS4, I made some friends at are school, and this @DATE1 I'm going to play yu-gi-oh card with one of them named @PERSON1 who goes to are church, @CAPS2 brother @CAPS4 told me oh... @PERSON1 goes to are school? I said yea and @CAPS6 said I played yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shock since @CAPS2 older brother knew @CAPS6 was and i didn't that time. I asked him why @CAPS6 didn't tell me @CAPS6 knew someone that play yu-gi-oh card, @CAPS6 said "" cause you didn't ask"" I was like... Oh.....

4229,2,"I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography. However there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents @MONTH1 think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving.     The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life. It @MONTH1 even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises.     I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, and sex novels, racist books,  ect. Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers, and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there. Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world. If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books",4,4,4,6.0
585,1,"Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Polution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Their the more, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any excirsive, which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This @MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the @ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. @PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the @ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers, she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes. @PERSON1 told me, ""@CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are.",5,6,11,9.0

Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family.

12989,5,"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author.",3,4,4,10.0

But then some books are not offensive too everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries. I can relate too @CAPS2 discovering books that's not educational for them. It's up too the parents too show their @CAPS2 what too read and what not too read. This can also happen with movies, certain movies that @CAPS2 can and can't watch. The reason I say this is because if it was up too @CAPS2 on their own too decide what they would want too do, it would usually be negative results. Thats what parents are for.      I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young too realize what I was watching and what I was trying too do from a movie. I had too learn from my parents that the things I were doing was not rational. Then I realize that I was making mistakes. It was nothing cool about it. friends had told me that as well. So i figured out the hard way. I don't want any @CAPS2 to experience that.      Not all parents can stop all @CAPS2 from discovering some disburbing things from books, music, magazines and all. What I'm trying too say that it can be reduced. Some parents can prevent it from happening. somethings can get in sink too a @CAPS2 brain and it could never be helped or solved. These things are serious and some people don't take it likely. And thats where it takes effect. Its up tookids parents or role models to show that some things are'nt meant for them too see until the right time.          I'm not telling parents to trap their @CAPS2 from the world. What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that their going to witness some things. They just have to be prepared too see them and hopefully it does'nt take a negative impact on them. Hopefully they would be smart enough too tell what's right from wrong. Its up too the parents to assist their @CAPS2. Its up too the @CAPS2 too know whats good for them.     I do believe that some @CAPS2 are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, too know that they were young, because I grew out of that myself. And if I can do it, so can they.

3394,2,"What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.",3,4,3,4.0

21110,8," Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family.

Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""?

Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to no how to do if you want to get a decinte job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on facebook and other website were you can make friend and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand-eye coordination but also you are most likly to get a good job if you no how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand-eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand-eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now alot of people go on facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy youself by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tommorrows weather.

3339,2,"There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music",4,4,4,6.0

The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you leran more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it.

In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life.

15330,6,"four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire state Building, although two ships got very close.",4,4,4,10.0

4484,2,"Do I think that certain materials that are offensive to other people be removed from the libraries? In my opinion I say no to this question. I say this because another person in the library might like the certain material that you feel offesive by. I don't think certain things that are offensive to one person should be removed. It can be an enjoyment to read to the next person. In the follow paragraphs I will continue to support more of my answer.          A library is built for other people enjoyment. If a person finds somthing offensive to them I don't think they should get mad because it wasn't put there to hurt you maybe the person that wrote the book went threw the same excat thing you did. Most write books, create music, and produce movies to express themselves. They put things out there like that because they could encourage someone else.           Personally I have never found a book, song, or movie to be offensive to me. I know that that the person writing the book wasn't tlking to me so I don't see why I have the right to get upset and that goes for everybody else. Most people who find things offensive in a library are always looking at the bad side of the situation. There is always a good side to every situation. Having a good and positive attitude you should see the brighter side of things.          Most magazines that you read @PERCENT1 of it is talking about celebraties, so that really should'nt have nothing to do with you unless you so in love with that celebraty and just have to say sumthing about it. Other than that it's none of your concern. Music is a way of expressing ones self in ther own way. A person shouldn't feel offended because a song writer wants to express him or herself. What if that's the only way they know how to express themselves. It's like your saying I don't want them to express themselves because it offends me. What if somebody didn't like the way you express yourself and wanted you to stop. I'm pretty you wouldn't like that.          In my conclusion I feel nothin should be removed from the library because it is offensive to someone. Certain things are put there for certain people. Nobody likes the same thing.

1303,1,"Dear Local Newspaper On the subject of computers; Their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide veru important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers, I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many asisgnmenrs. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might nit even posses the information needed. On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand-eye coordination some peopel say ""you can learn hand-eye coordiantion outside too? Although that is true, typing is very fats and neat. As you can see my hand wriitng is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest hand writing ever.The way I see it computers are the fastert way of doing alot of things. So if you spend time writign neatly you might nit even be able to go outside and see nature. my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers. Sometime the easy way isn;'t always the best way thats why we must have balance. Do not infrom people to stop using computers but to balance thier time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. for example, coffiene, In large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small you turn to caffiene and it helpd, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everwhere, trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession we dont need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative. So you see comuters are evry helpful to some balance is the answer!",3,4,7,5.0

3904,2,"Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored.

21429,8,"The @CAPS1-inspirational, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 I @CAPS5 the @CAPS6 of @CAPS7 -- @PERSON1. What is @CAPS13, exactly? Some might say, ""@CAPS8, that's obvious. @CAPS13's a sound, emitted from a person when they think something is funny!"" That's as good a response as any other, and certainly quite believable. But I believe laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a marginally-humorous, less-than-inspirational story about my experiences as a @CAPS9-@CAPS10-@CAPS11 basketball player.  This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain-drenched winter months in which @CAPS13 took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the ""sit-outs"" zone in middle school @LOCATION1, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed ""better than dirt"" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as @CAPS13 was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action.  Our team could play basketball, but not often on the same level as the teams we faced. As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball-playing abilities could change that.  @CAPS13 was one game in particular twhen I discovered I didn't have to play in order to help my team. @CAPS13 was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about @NUM1 points against a team we had fared @CAPS8 against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, @PERSON2, was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only made him embarrassed him more. Sitting beside @PERSON2, I could feel the anger radiating off of him. He was ranting under his breath over number @NUM2, the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while @NUM2's fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball-player, his voice -- a good octave above his teammates' -- was much more @CAPS8 suited for covering @ORGANIZATION1 songs than calling out plays. I turned towards @PERSON2, tapping him on the shoulder, and informed him of my insight. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and ""don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-murder-@CAPS12"" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: ""@CAPS12 always know @CAPS4 to make us laugh, @PERSON1"". Suddenly @CAPS13 dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates' faces. I was able to use @CAPS7 to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made @CAPS13 my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities.  And so @CAPS13 was. Some players had quick hands, others had a flawless shot. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers, my friends, the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations. I didn't receive an award, a recognition of athletic ability. Instead I found the satisfaction of making people smile, of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear -- replaced with optimism and hope. Laughter is what pushed my teammates past anger, to be the best they could be. So, @CAPS12 tell me: Is laughter simply noise that a person makes when something is funny, or is @CAPS13 something more?  Spoiler alert: @CAPS13's much, much more.",30,25,55,9.166666666666666

We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.

1255,1,"Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people.

Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people.

Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful.

20983,8," Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt.",20,23,43,7.166666666666667
42,1,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer. Studys show taht @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probibly wont have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer. And you never know what they could be like. Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others. My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day don't come out because your on the computer. If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you.,4,4,8,6.0

I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right?

20717,8," Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2.

That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, Id see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project.

Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.One of the greatest obstacle to let the dirigibles docked there, was the weather.

15259,6,"the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable teather to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame.Another obstacle the builder's faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. this meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved @NUM1 floor by a special elevator.

1419,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health.",5,5,10,8.0

3214,2,"Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. We now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in the countries like @LOCATION2, where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship.     Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. Public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the @ORGANIZATION1. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture. One public library @MONTH1 be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn.     Libraries today @MONTH1 carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. Libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout @LOCATION1 in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive.     Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; '@ORGANIZATION2', or '@ORGANIZATION3', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary.     Public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.",4,5,4,6.0

Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt hands upon @CAPS15 shoulder and arm. I looked up at @CAPS15 helper and saw a girl. Not @CAPS5 a girl but a gorgeous girl.

I figured out that @CAPS3 was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue and @CAPS3 always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the playground some more @CAPS5 talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS3 had a brother and sister. her response was that @CAPS3 does have a brother, and two sisters. While I was listening to her I noticed @CAPS3 was very deep into thought and asked what @CAPS3 was thinking about and @CAPS3 quickly replied. ""@CAPS11, @CAPS5 wondering why I'm so happy with you.""""well it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be @CAPS15 charms working on you."" I replied with a @CAPS12 accent.""@CAPS13 @CAPS4 its definitely that."" @CAPS3 barely got out the words cause of laughter. Suddenly there was a car horn honking and we said our goodbye's and @CAPS3 left. I sat there watching the car go down the road and was hoping that we @MONTH1 see each other again, but in a way I knew we wouldnt because @CAPS15 mom, and I were moving from the city to a small town half way across the country.

My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain.

I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty.

Should there be censorship in libraries?     In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library.  If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library.  Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream.  They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book.     However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately.  For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it.  What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.  If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room.     If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures.  For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.     Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar.  While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended",4,3,4,6.0

I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out.

If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain.

The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no  problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not  have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials.

Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race.     There are two arguments to cenorship in libraries. I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, everyone is given the right of free speech. Taking someones work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that persons' rights. Also, people go to libraries to find something out. They look for knowledge and taking away a persons' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. When one article gets censored another artical after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn.     Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines. These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version. All minor adjustments and easy to make.     Taking media off the shelves is not needed.

The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind speed on the top of the Empire State building would be terrible because the Dirigible's tail is basically weightless and it would move around violently which could make the support beams give out, or could put people's life in danger below. Lüsted said, ""But using these at the Empire State Building; where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street is neither practical nor safe."" Another reason as to why the Mooring Mast can not be constructed is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Lüsted stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" It is not legal for the Dirigible to even be in the viscinity of the building which makes it impossible to do.",3,3,3,7.5

3476,2,"Dear newspaper,     In my opinion I don't think that censorship in libraries should be on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines and more materials. Censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I diagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials.     Many libraries in the world @MONTH1 have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have alot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they @MONTH1 have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicent content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials but in my opinion they also shouldn't let under age children check out any kind of material that is only ment to be viewed by adults. Also if computer access is offered to children, an adult superior visor should be near by to make sure that no explicent content is being viewed.     Censoring in libraries could resolve in many problems, such as, customers not getting all the information they need for a centain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers. Yes, most people @MONTH1 visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people, those wrong reasons @MONTH1 be the reason for them to gain more information.     Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain.      In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad, it can also mean that the material is just not appropreite to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either but it can hide alot of information from us which is not good at all.",3,3,3,4.0
15742,6,"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. The builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur.

In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes.

"" @CAPS5 to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high ranning industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. this could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took.

If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should deffinately be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technoligy has benefited many people.

Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.

There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it.

I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves?Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite. If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book.           There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive. Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything.

The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society.     To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media. the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place.     Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next @CAPS3 vinci, @PERSON1, or anyother great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age.     Society possess a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world. So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth. The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned.

The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places.

1150,1,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a great piece of technology. Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convienience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly beleive that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convienience. Most people in @LOCATION1 have a computer in their home. Computers are convienient because you pay bills on the internet. You email co-workers about jobs. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their buisness is more noticeable. As you can see, computers are a very convienient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you can learn just about anything. You can learn about @CAPS5 history, sports, you can learn about current events in the world. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in @LOCATION1's education, pleasure and convienience. I hope you listened to my opinion on computers and I also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are.",4,4,8,6.0

3546,2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern;      As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that @MONTH1 be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.      As @CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that @MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.      Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they @MONTH1 only see @CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!     Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in @LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.     Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.",4,4,4,6.0

4458,2,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?  I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves.  There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it.  Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves.       One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote.  She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf.  Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day.  Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library.       Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this.  As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1.  Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries.  Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing.  How would a library handle this situation.  If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries.  There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it.  Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it.  They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves.  There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves.       My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies.  Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve.  If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective.  The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner.  It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc.  The public has to accept those choices.  You have to look at it from their view.  Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them.  It's just not the right way to handle things.     After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that.  It's never been that way and it should never be that way.  Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate.  But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be",4,4,4,6.0
4604,2,"What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that.     First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article. But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world.     Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point.     Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her. And now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world. This is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important.      Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored",4,4,4,6.0

431,1,"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!",5,6,11,9.0

A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I dont want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with.

""@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready and so @CAPS1 do this thing"" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough,"" @CAPS2 explained. ""well we are all here! so @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 to this opportunity and @NUM1 and @PERSON1 look out for cars!"" i yelled as @CAPS2 and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. ""@CAPS21 we must wait,"" @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS21 were, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS22,"" i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS23 up,"" I screamed! We all @CAPS23 right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS6! Suddenly out of @CAPS21 where @CAPS6 came running, as he @CAPS22 reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION1 although we could have guessed! As the @CAPS25 and long @ORGANIZATION1 rapped up we all called quits and hit the sack at my house. But laughter wasn't in short supply that @ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep!",22,20,42,7.0

Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People @MONTH1 say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. @CAPS1 there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even @CAPS1 it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut @CAPS2 out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying ""@CAPS1 your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me."" @CAPS2 was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated ""well this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened @CAPS2, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to @LOCATION1 and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me.

For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person.

Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion.

14913,6,"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. Lüsted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

4754,2,"Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us.",5,5,5,8.0

When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mase causing it to not be safe.",3,3,3,7.5

1179,1,I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family. If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabing your attention more than going outside. That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend. If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer. That effects the relationship with your family. Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat. Now your not working out and you just keep eating. So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick. Thats why most people are not healthy because of computers. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend. Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave. That is messing up the relationship with your family. Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping. I your playing a realy good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you don't sleep. Then after a while you get addicted and won't stop playing. So you won't get sleep and if you have school you won't be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game. So thats why computer aren't so good. It can mess up your health. I can mess up your social life with family and friends. You won't get a lot of sleep and won't be able to concentrate.,4,4,8,6.0

Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a losh, steamy, jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times. Although this information @MONTH1 be in a local library. Going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with soemone easily is an unbeliveable privalige, that would be none existant without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in othe areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do experiments. With a simulated expiriment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely acurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years therew ill be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positivly effected by computers. ALthough some people @MONTH1 think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I @PERCENT1 disagree. People have learning, talking, and advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have effected people positivley in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of that.",5,6,11,9.0

Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives. Computers are espicially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on @LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on @LOCATION1, then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finaly he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay @NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school. Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their busnesses would fail. Computer make busnes much easier, espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible. On a computer, busnesses can store customer information, comppare income, and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet. Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper. Also busnesses con save time of having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next monet and the month after; and they coud emall impertant things such as sales projections and other things as well. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Lets say this, a moter, has a child! who is sick and she wants to know the to heal him, what to feel him, and what medicine to give hime. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmail the websites for next time. Then her other child comes provide, and she wants to find a health snork. She can feed him which she ca do online. Next she ways to make chicken fried rice,out she wnet know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finaly after dinner she need to cleen a stain on the carpet but it wont come out so she buys a carpet cleener from the web. Computers have just moderthy mothers day so much easier.

21610,8," People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over priced society. It has been said by those infamous ""they"" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but i have to disagree with ""them"". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a @DATE1 and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that i had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year i had decided that now that i was in high school, birthday parties were a no go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would i do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what i did almost every other normal @DATE1. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that its my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me then being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and @NUM1 months. We are not the most well functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that buzz light year has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than buzz light year.  The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if i wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, make a snarky comment or do anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish i laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. Its healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter. ",20,20,40,6.666666666666667

Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless.

21471,8," Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part.

16390,6,"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck.",4,4,4,10.0

Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want.",4,4,8,6.0
3851,2,"A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things.          Magazines @MONTH1 not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying.      No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @MONTH1  understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world.",3,3,3,4.0

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.

I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS6's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS7. Hey."" @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious.

I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence.

4481,2,"Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should. The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. If the @CAPS1 wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants.     Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @CAPS1 or people claim them to be.    Another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @CAPS1 to it's online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.     Now the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now. Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place.     So in conclusion the @CAPS1 should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money which they don't have. Customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money.

21130,8," I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them.

888,1,"Dear residents of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier. Computers can help us in so many ways including making learning easier, helps students do better in @CAPS4, nad serves as a great teaching tool. One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask hao a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, @CAPS1 sounds crazy, but its true! Let's say you're a middle @CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; @CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just google search what your topic in and @CAPS3! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, prettty cool right? Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you @CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @CAPS4? That's right, computers allow students to do better in @CAPS4. Websites such as edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz your treacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with things like absentees, weekends and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get @CAPS1 back @CAPS1's time for a chapter test with @PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you didn't do @CAPS2 on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do @CAPS2 on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before , you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @CAPS2 on the test. As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, @CAPS1 just seems like there are speaking another language? @CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on youtube explaining @CAPS1? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because @CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you understand why computers are useful, now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool. These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and I hope you keep using them in our community.",5,5,10,8.0
15676,6,"In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun.",3,3,3,7.5

Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.' It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents.' The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed.",3,3,3,7.5
4219,2,"To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern,     @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should should have some censorship, but up to a specific point.     We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone?     Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Eveyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point.     Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there.     When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. @CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. @CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. Afterall, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty.     Thank you.",5,5,5,8.0

Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety",4,3,4,6.0

If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame.

I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better.     From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race. And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day. Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock.     Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience.

I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive.      Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them.

I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them.       If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves.

I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?     You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?",4,4,4,6.0

14883,6,"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants.",3,3,3,7.5

With a simple library card, children could check out a   boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship.     Books are big, powerful, and a vast amount of information. Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through. This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life. Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands.

Well it really don't matter what the reason is, but its good to laugh. Laughing is great for you an it brings fun, joy, an helps you enjoy little more. My mom and I have a great relationship. Every time we are together, or we start talking we will laugh an crack each other up. Laughing has helped us get to having a great relationship were we can tell each other anything. I can go to her any time an ask her for help. I can go an talk to her any time I need to now. Be for we had a great relationship she wasn't doing to good she was involved in not to good of things. She was very depressed too. Ill tell you a little about it.   My day started off as a normal school day, I got up got ready, got on thus to school then be for I new it I was on the bus on my way home. I get off a block or two away from my house and then I walk home. I walk and walk, an about ten minutes later I get up to my house. I go to my room an put my bags down on my bed and go say hi to my mom. I walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair. I had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. Well of course she said yes.She gets her shoes on an I do the same.We walk down are drive way an that's where the walk starts.        We started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way. We walked straight for about five minutes, then take a right.We walk that way for about ten minutes an turn left. Their is a little store on that coroner. We stopped their to buy some water an some snacks on the walk. After we get done we start walking east on the road. When I looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day. Like anyone i asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad, and depressed. From that I knew i need to talk to her an make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends. I knew if i could make her laugh, an help her get better, it would help us get along better an help each other out in the long run. I love my mom an I hate seeing people down. I though all this in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh.  The walk was about three to four miles long. for the rest of the time I got her to laugh an laugh the whole way back. It made her feel a lot better i know that. Later that day she came in my room and we played some bored games and watch a movie or two. We really just talked and hung out for the rest of the day. We went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship. We were both happy this had happened. About two months from the first walk w had she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her out with what she was going though. I think laughter is a great thing in life. For me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love laughing, and I love making people laugh it is fun to laugh an fun to make people laugh. Laughter makes great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny an have people laugh with you.    ",15,19,34,5.666666666666667

Every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies, books, and music we all have different testes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they make so meny different types of ever thing becuse we do have different beliefes like relegen, class, and cultur.     Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it of the shelf becuse someone somewhere thought it was offersive we would not have music or any thing like that. I don't really have to meny thing that I get offened by but I do know that I have seen some showes that were that way and some people I'm guessing thought was funny.     Books, there are meny different gerens in that too just like music so if it has a bad work, or a rude annicdout some people @MONTH1 not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything. Take for an example The @CAPS1 is one of the most read books in the world and if they just took it off the shelf becuse some people don't believe in it so meny things would change and releges are not going to be the same in any way.          That is the way is going to be with it all and most people do take offens to that. The way i put it in my head is that if they don't like it they don't have to read, watch, or leasn to it. Every thing in all of these bisnisses is in taking a resk. Its all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc.       So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this. That is why we have our own free will and and make the choes that you want to good or bad, right or wroung. You might not think about it much but thing like this do happen it might not be in your town but some where out there in the world it will be happening",3,3,3,4.0

Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, was neither practical nor safe. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.

3072,2,"Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one. through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic.     Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive. If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it. You just simply have to grab a new book. Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? If thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. After you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. Thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her.     The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me I can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......!  Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie. What do you do? In my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take action. If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales. I've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves.     My belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books! Now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. But if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one. If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs.     This article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic. However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library. Maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. thanks for reading",4,4,4,6.0

3440,2,"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case",4,4,4,6.0

Also the over all reasearch on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work. In example use @CAPS6 for projects. Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Wheather its for college or for the sake of your own learning.

Many people, @CAPS7 a days work at home, they have their own office. They all most create their own company. Another reason is many people also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, when could also or another reason for this.

My mother said she do @CAPS6 more often @CAPS7 that she knows how to use @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you.

I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons why I go online is b/c they have more variety and sizes. @CAPS7 for the news, thats all for my parents b/c i don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings @CAPS7 that I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if its mimumum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement!

Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says ""They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people."" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all.",5,6,11,9.0

Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family.

4403,2,"What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf.",4,4,4,6.0

It teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand-eye coordination. For instance if you're in a rush to type an amazing long essay you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy-dandy keys are. However, if would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation/honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to re-consider this amazing trip. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. On blistering cold days and you can't go outside, or call them because you don't have phone you can myspace or facebook them as long as you want as long as you have a @NUM1 and only email address that nobody else has. Now it's time to decide! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people.

Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games, I know I do. It's so they don't waste their time being bored all day. Excersising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into, but even though they do that, they don't push away the computer.

For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy.

The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place.          If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online. There is no reason why you shopuld have any compliants to a library the library is a place to help you. It is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library.     Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inapproapriate then order magazines online. If you don't like there books then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored.",3,3,3,4.0
12413,5,"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you.",2,2,2,5.0

I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all @CAPS6 important information organized."" @CAPS3 you question a leading doctor? I agree with @PERSON3 and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't balme it on computers. With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something's very wrong with them."" say's @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How @CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I @CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computer's for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision. you shouln't go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else's fault but that persons. This is a great way to keep in contact with other's. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too.

215,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies, such as computers have an humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise.

Study show that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society, says' that if this increases @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet, continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 year old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. @CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All @ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature. Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook, my space and @CAPS6 others.

A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer. This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have effected the interaction between family and friends. ""@CAPS6 people hav only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings."" says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are a major importance in everyones lives.

First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all.

And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on.

And besides, most kids don't don't stay on the computer very long anyways. Homeworks, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it can you down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. If you go to the school web page then theres a link that brings you in a math games. Theres even a to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework.

Okay some people like different things and the other people dont agree on it. Thats how things work. If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened. I totally agree on that. Like ciggerettes. Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see. Once again i would want to remove that from the shelfs.     There would be so many conflicts if this happened. Everyone likes different things. So i think everyone is going to get offened by taking things away that looks offensive towards them. This goes from kids to adults. Every age would be bothered by this.      Now this is my against veiw on this subject. This would make me very mad if i admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offened by it so they take it away from the people and that like that object. All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad. Thats how its suppost to be. We all have are opinions. We all like different things. We all have to get over it if we dont like it or dont get along with it. Thats something we have to take in and suck it up.     So on this subject im for both.

3820,2,"Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.     Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segragted by race. The segragation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segragation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media.     Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong?     In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.",3,3,3,4.0

Some stuff will have lables on them like parental guidence to show that only particular age person can have. From my experience is that it's ok, but if it gets out of hand then I just leave it and go to the next thing. Although rmoving the books from most people might not help alot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else.

The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. And to let passengers on & off.Safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of pointy buildings this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also, the law to fly too low. By the late 1930's the mooring mast plan disappeared.",3,3,3,7.5

Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians.

The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building.

However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast.

With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor.

Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard.

People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people?

If they have life problems then they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with people, it still is no replacement for the real thing.

Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. I think it's a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can't talk to in real life. And, it's a good way to help friends and be there for them. It's done in moderation though.

3642,2,"Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.",3,3,3,4.0

3787,2,I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.     I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book.     Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly.     If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.,3,3,3,4.0

One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary.",5,4,9,7.0

3600,2,"Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.     I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.     This is my opinion of the statement. Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement.

3809,2,"I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occuring.     If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctent reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because @CAPS11 or she finds it offensive? Because @CAPS11 or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.      Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @PERSON3. To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were censored because of the racist language. @CAPS12 language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS9 is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in @LOCATION1. The main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story.     Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated @CAPS10 movie or reading a letter to @ORGANIZATION3 is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.     If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then @CAPS11 or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. @PERSON2 said, '@CAPS11 who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' @CAPS12 is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.     These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them.      Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therfore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries",5,5,5,8.0

My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and arrived to my body unconscious. He took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm. In doing so he accidentally locked the door from the outside which locked him and me in the shop. As I woke up from my faint sleep with a splitting headache all i could remember happening was the rain pounding against the side of the woodshed. @CAPS2 was sitting next to me with a sad look on his face and also some shock as well.

I looked around trying to find something to get the door off but couldn't find out what anything was. My parents could not hear us over the storm since they were asleep and we were helpless no matter what we tried. So instead of looking on the gloomy side we decided to make some stories and tell jokes to pass the time till it was morning again.

I started talking about how big @PERSON1's ears were and we both started cracking up with laughter uncontrollably he then came back to me with how big @ORGANIZATION1's lips were and i laughed so hard i couldn't breath. we looked through the holes in the shop to see the morning dew on the grass and birds chirping in trees and i knew it wouldn't be long before we were found.

It @MONTH1 be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity. I know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.     If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life.

1639,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy.

21299,8," Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME1.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME1 we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS2-field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON1 responded ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END ",20,21,41,6.833333333333333

4766,2,"In todays world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work.     One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, @CAPS1 books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many @CAPS1 authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them.      Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above @NUM1 should be a definent no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out.     Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine @CAPS3, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation.     America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not.",5,4,5,8.0

217,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand - eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library and it can improve social skills. Continue reading to find out why. Computers, we use them everyday. They are teaching us something. We @MONTH1 not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand-eye coordination. We type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type, one mistake and automatically our hand fix it. Or maybe when we are playing games online, the same thing applies. Our eyes are looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand-eye Coordination is a skill you need on sports, and I believe that computers, since we spend time on them are the quick way to learn that skill. Next, how many student's parents work? My parents do. Something it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives in walking distance to one. That's when a computer helps. If you have a project to do, but your parents work, you can just @ORGANIZATION1 it up, you might even get more information, then what you can get in the library. Hows that? you ask. Well, for an example, @CAPS1 you had to do a project on @CAPS2. Let's just say, you managed to go to a library, but apparently there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were checked out. You can always check it out from another library, but that might not come soon enough, on a survey @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them. So what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer improves your social skils. When I first moved here I was a very shy person. When I made a @CAPS3, I @CAPS4 talking to people who go to my school. I even became friends with them. I'm not saying that you should just stop talking to people in person, and use @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 and communicate. @CAPS9 I am saying is that if you start talking to them online, you know them a little, then when you talk in person you will see you have alot in common, with that person, and soon you can become friends. Another thing, that is somewhat related to this. I have many friends living in @LOCATION1, and many cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS9 over. We @CAPS9 know, you can't travel @CAPS9 the time, sometimes you can't even get to see them. Thats @CAPS10 social networks help. You can keep in touch, plus @CAPS11.S. not even waste minutes on you phone. Can it get better? In conclusion, Computers have a very positive effect on people.

3003,2,"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values.

20809,8,"@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. @CAPS2!"", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks ""@CAPS3's @CAPS4?"". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first ""love"". ""I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore"", that was the last thing he said to me. My first ""love"" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. ""@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade"", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore.

So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information an everything so people can be more knowledge so if they're more knowledged they can probably get a really good job that pays alot.

They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions.     There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children. I think that they should either be placed more appropriatly or removed completely. Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts.     Personally, I think that most fictional books are intertainment only. They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part. If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way.      Most Libraries have areas sectioned of for adults only but they aren't monitored. So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material? They wouldn't have the slightest clue.     I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot, so why limit them to what they already know about? There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines. Shouldn't they be banned too?     The world is exposed to offensive material everyday. We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way. But young children don't know better, so there is no gaurentee that they won't take ideas from inaprpropriate viewings and use them.

If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their.

In @CAPS2 oppinion they are not beneficial. First when on the computer people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have approprate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obiese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a ""@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4.

With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends.

607,1,"Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think its a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on-line that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 need an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop on-line, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends on-line is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk on-line usually talk with their best friends. If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young, usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and wont need to look at them alot. Soon, you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time. This @MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words. In conclusion, I think, computers don't hace too much of an effect on people. As long as they'er not on there for more than two hours, then they're fine. Using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages.",4,5,9,7.0

The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas.

Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from.

In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location.

3278,2,"Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others @MONTH1 not. The censorship that I am discussing  is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone.     The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for peole to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people @MONTH1 never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone.     The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person @MONTH1 enjoy that book and many others @MONTH1 like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to.     The last reason is parents can limit what their children read.If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is innapropiate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves.     The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Somone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public.  Also people people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a books cahnce to be loved by censoring it.",4,5,4,6.0

So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends.

One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal.

Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @CAPS3.     Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will.     Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are.      I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read.

By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want.      There should not be any banning of books.

I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried.

I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.

We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person.

If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 .

An offensive book or movie or even music shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it. People @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I will help and explain my own opinion in why i dont think offensive books, movies,music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf.     If a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf. Somebody most likley worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf. If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section. I have not had any real experiences with this but I know people are awear of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book. Same thing with music and @CAPS1's. Music is music and it is there to be listened too. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. @CAPS1's usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up. If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section. For instance at my old library where I used to live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 they would put all rated @CAPS2 movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent with you.

3344,2,"Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves",3,3,3,4.0

14986,6,The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.,3,3,3,7.5

To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off.

Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.      Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them.     The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old.

Many students have report due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return. Many students either forget they have a book out or even past due. So it makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines and etc., are not return people should have to be punished more than just having to pay a overdue fee.     I have witnesses alot of students who didn't either want to turn in the book thr checked out. We the junior class at my high school had a term paper that we need books, newspaper, internet and magazines. Lucky, The senior class turned in all of their book, newspaper, internet, magazines and etc., that they used on their term papers, we the junior class were able to sucess on our term paper. But many juniors still havent reutrn the materials they have used.The teachers have threqten them with overdue fees and or have to pay for the losted material.

Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. @CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves.  Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries.  I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books.  Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons.     First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view.  How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves.  I don't think that many people would enjoy that.  I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal.  When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines.  Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see.  I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.  The parents point of view makes things a lot worse.      Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him.  You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story.  You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story!  What do you do?             Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book.  Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere.  How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone?  I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong.  Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it.      When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library.  This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story.  If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea.  It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to.  If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. @CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries.     My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully.  If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic.  Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1.

3080,2,"I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic.     I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of @PERCENT1 of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.          Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.     Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.     All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose.",4,4,4,6.0

4600,2,"Censorship is method of limiting certain contant that has been deemed inapropriate. This method is widely used today in the modern world. Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainent like television and internet utilize such methods shouldn't our libraries.Also if these methods are not made manditory should there be a block on certain tittles that our children could get there hands on.       This limiting agent called censorship can be very usefull in our everyday lives. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view. This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones. So if the procautionary measuers are being taken on the following products wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries. Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to waunder through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inaproiate book for their age group. Personally that is what a library should be like to me.         Discussing the topic that was touched on before .A block should be manditory for libraries. This block would not abolish the books completly but rather would limit their viewing audience. The books should be cateragized by age group. And with the block certain children, based on age ,would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materals from reaching children that are not mature enough.     Certain materials should not be view by younger children. That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experiance comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for maturer audiences. These tittles heavily influence a childs thoughts and actions. Just the other day a cousin of mine no older than @NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these question will probably never be known but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up and that is censoring what children read, view or listen to in our libraries",4,4,4,6.0
4272,2,"Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No I do not believe this statement for many reasons. If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed.     One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves. This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that @MONTH1 be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex. This @MONTH1 lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school.     Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion.     This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem.     Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive. It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem",4,4,4,6.0

Without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology. Without technology things would be so much harder. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures, and getting information. If we didn't have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash. i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer.

1223,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers are good for people. I believe this because many people get to see things that on their daily basis wouldnt. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that many people now a days work alot so they might not have time to remember little things such as going to buy newspaper or they might not even have time to watch the news on tv, but because of computers they can read or see the same things but in less time. Some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. This benefits sociaty its own way. I believe computers are very useful to everyone. C omputers can help people get in touch. They can keep in touch by using webcam and etc. It could also let them communicate. Computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world. It gives people a chanve to see the people you couldnt see from afar. In my opinion people can also learn from computers. Computers have many positive effects that are very important. They give people a chance to learn things. This can benefit sociaty because the more knowledge people have the better it is. It gives people who didnt get a chance to learn what they wanted to actually do so and learn it. Computers do benefit sociaty lets take @PERSON1 for example he says that @PERCENT1 of kids believe that computers have helped them in their own way. Many people can be bored at times but because of computers and the fun things it has such as games, videos... etc..

(takes away boredom and lets them get good hand eye coordination) Computers also benefit sociaty by letting people has such technology. Many time technology is needed in everyones life. Technology has helped many people and still continues to. Computers is one of the technology that helps people. Technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do. In conclusion I believe computers have many great positive effects on people, and it also doesnt only benifit people that use this technology it benifits others in a way too.

In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs.

Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring.   I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon.

15602,6,Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas. The invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and unsafe.,3,3,3,7.5

181,1,"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With internet, you can do things like play games, research information, and even talk to friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These includes that computers improve hand-eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then literally assigned by the doctor to play computer games to help his hand-eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 agree that computers can have a gargantuah, positive impact on reflexes and hand-eye coordination. If computers heldful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are. the internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schoold, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to research using a computer. Principal of new city @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at leat every week if not more. They are fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are getway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long-distance phone calls are too expensive most of the world and I rely on computers to talk to out far-away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2; (my @CAPS3 friend) and I. However, computers are not only used long distance. I also use computers to e-mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says. ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and Family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. You must have access to a computer in my opinion, in order to thrive in life.",5,5,10,8.0

If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also @CAPS6 I think there should not be censorship in libraries.     @CAPS5 first reason is freedom of the press. In our @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read.     Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our @ORGANIZATION1 of @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our @CAPS1 given rights, @CAPS7 people are offended by books and things of that nature.     A personal experience I have was one day @CAPS5 friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the @DATE1's and slavery. Unfortunately, @CAPS5 friend was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then.     @CAPS5 friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, '@CAPS4 you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' @CAPS5 friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.     After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. '@CAPS6's that?', he said. I said, '@CAPS7 if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, @CAPS7 somebody would find something hurtful.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said.     Censorship isn't fair, @CAPS7 it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy.

I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place's, people, culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you with. The time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it. Computers make you become become smarter. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more excerise. My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay's and when you have good hand-eye coordination you dont make a lot of mistake's typing. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it beneifts society.",4,4,8,6.0

I jumped in my truck and headed to my mothers house.While on the way I stopped to get some gas at the gas station. Fifteenth minutes later I arrived at my moms house. once arrived my brother was out side waiting for me. @ORGANIZATION1 came up to the truck and helped me with my bag and the door. Once I was in the house I walked over to the kitchen saw my @CAPS1, and gave her a hug, and asked her how she was doing? She replied, I'm alright hunny, then asked me what was new, with myself? I said nothing much @CAPS1, hanging out trying to stay out of trouble. I asked her is there anything she needed me to do? Or needs to be done? My om named off a couple things that needed to be done around the house. After she was done telling me some of the things i headed to my room to change into my work cloths, then headed out side. I grabbed my brother on the way because he was going to help me out. While we were down at the garage @ORGANIZATION1 brings up the fact that I haven't been there in a while he said party tonight. I replied ok. While I was done working on the garage, my dad came down and said the fence needs to be fixed, so we moved the tractor over and fixed the fence.

But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.",3,2,3,10.0
503,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites. Also using computer helps you talk to people you know that maybe you haven't talk to in a while and you don't know their number. I think that having a computer makes you smart because i mean you still do other stuff besides be on the computer all day, when you are not on you are either hanging out with friends/family or you are eating or sleeping/working out or just doing something like homework. I believe using a computer is part of you healthy choices and you can lean a lot more than you really think you can. Using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing. I computer can be very health for you hands because when you are consteatly moving you hands gives them more strength and can give you stronger muscles in your hands and lower arms. Inconclusion, I believe that computers are health for you don't take anytime away from exercising time or time with friends/family/sports/sleep/ or eating. Computers are a hundred percent health for you. So i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day.",4,4,8,6.0
15181,6,"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, both during construction and after. During The creation of the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building, because the stress of the load and wind pressure would add stress to the building's frame; instead, they had to transmit the load and pressure to the foundation, modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. Builders also wantd the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, needing to make the tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside. After the creation Of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen-using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire as a result. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents. Dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast  Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would be illegal, therefore, for a dirigible to tie up to the building Or even fly too close to the area.",3,4,4,10.0
4186,2,"I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming.I think it should be censored and taking off the shelf. If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf. You should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted. I hope something I write will propose my reasons.              I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taking off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive. I believe things in the nature should be handled in great authority. If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens.              Just think if a visitor come in and pick up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of beeing looked at, then they would be very offened. For them to come there it had to be a reson that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted. It is very inappropiate to have things that are offensive in the library.                It is plenty of different reason people come to libraries. Some come to get away, and to others its a daily routine. Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at. Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at. Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will loose alot of fellow friends and alot of business. Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get peoples attention.                          To answer the question @CAPS1, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people. If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be alot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending.

However some people should limit themselves on things like facebook and twitter, some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not now the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computer can be very valueable to all students is because lets say a student has a quiz on mitusis and cells in science the next day and doesnt really understand it they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz. Another reason that computer are good for people is because it helps them communicate with theri friends. Some kids are only and arent that gool at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends. however like I said earlier some poepleget carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stoffs and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites.

15562,6,"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field.",4,3,4,10.0

As said in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic the accident would be if it was over a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle faced was the brutal winds which occur at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2).

21147,8," Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates.

We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook, that is why that whole statement, ""spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be acheived without a computer.

4221,2,I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a   room just for grown ups. In the dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids cannot go in there with out a parent. So whenever you go in there your parent are with you. But i dont think you can check them out. But if i had a kid i would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older so i think there should be seperate rooms. So whenever they got older and maturd they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them.      But on the other hand why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not there gonna see iot other places or from other people then they go home asking there mom what this means and stuff why not let them learn on ther own from a book. There are some people that woulf agree with that but then there are people that would disagree with that. So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want or maybe there should be rules that you cant go in there with out a parent.          I don't no what to do maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not. But some people would be mad over that so if you chose one someone would not like it or aomething like that.My upion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on there own.Some people would think im a bad parent but would you want you child to find out somwhere else.,2,2,2,2.0

3847,2,"As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read. I found my self embarrassed  and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs. A @NUM1 year old girl should not be able to see an inappriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be.  Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves. The movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is.      You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that so should I. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini. Sports @CAPS3 prides its self on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2 a bunch of @CAPS8 laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that its @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5  magazines and drool over how the center fold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too.      Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see. Many of these books have images of how do this and that. That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When yougo to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people @MONTH1 think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book. They see the cover that intrigue them. They think oh this girl is pretty.Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents. The kids can just grow up the way that they should.      Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercorse really is. They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe. This isn't just fun and games. In @LOCATION1 today many young @CAPS8 get raped. Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young @CAPS8 as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made. Pornography is false, @CAPS8 don't just look at eachother andget turned on. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is.      Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow",4,5,4,6.0

Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do.

Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people.     When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards?

If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You @MONTH1 be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years.      Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention?  You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of poeple in this way. Poeple are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person.      What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and @CAPS3? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are critised and teased relentlessly becuase they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased.      Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people.

Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.

The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world.

As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me.

15089,6,"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became to great and finally shut down the idea. ",4,3,4,10.0

I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 and I. I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though. The whole day i was waiting for it to be @NUM2 so i could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready, because it was a sleep over. As i was one my way to her she called me and said ""before you get to my house look to the right.""  The whole way my dad and i were driving to her house i kept my eyes on the right side of the rode, i wasn't quit sure what i was looking for though. As we got closer i saw something in the bushes. It was @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2. I told my dad to honk at them so they knew i was there and as he did, they both pulled down there pants and mooned us! I was laughing so hard the whole night i kept thinking about the look on my dads face! Little did i know that wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night. Later on @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2 and I went on a walk down to the dock by @LOCATION1 house. While we were on the dock a bat flew by and @PERSON2 almost fell in the water cause she was so scared. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were standing behind her laughing so hard! By that time it was getting kind of dark and her neighbors were being really loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbors house and hid and started yelling things at them to quiet down! It was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from so they just kept looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet. We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet. That's not the funniest thing that happened either! As we were walking back to @LOCATION1 house we heard a car coming so we made a plan I stood in the middle of the street and @ORGANIZATION1 stood ahead of me while @PERSON2 was hiding in the bushes. The plan was @ORGANIZATION1 and I were going to pretend to be in a fight and @PERSON2 was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So the car starts turning the corner and me and @ORGANIZATION1 start fake fighting. As the car gets closer it starts slowing down and here come @PERSON2 running out of the bushes and @CAPS2! Pretends to fake shoot me. I fall to the ground like i am really hurt trying to hold back my laughs, and man did we think we got the people in the car good. Then we realize there is no way she actually shot me when there was no gun shot sound at all! So the people in the car come up closer and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is. When they got closer we realized it was just some of @ORGANIZATION1's family friends coming over for the party so they knew it was fake the whole time. When it got darker outside we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by @LOCATION1 house. We brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon of the bridge. When it hit the water it mad a really loud sound and split into a bunch of tiny pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest nights i have ever had. The next day all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on rope swings into the water. @ORGANIZATION1 got a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious! @PERSON2, @ORGANIZATION1 and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs.

For the most part though books are not all that offensive at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably cause a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids.     I know that during @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 over in germany many books were banded because they had something to do with catholicism or something that @PERSON3 believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time alot of what @PERSON2 wrote was banned for using the @CAPS4 word but people have to realize that when @PERSON2 was alive that was everyday laungage.     As for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned.     As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because there music is overtly racist.     I dont think that movies shouyld be banned form the libraries because of violence or anytning of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contians anything of the nature of pornagraphy but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway  so they are a step ahead of me.     I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves.

Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.          I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.           Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. But don't let them read it on there own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up. Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handel it.

Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggrivate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries.                             Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented. Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide.

For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company.

Next reason is to go outside, you can enjoy more stuff like sports, tag, and other activities. Instead of talking to a freind on the computer go to the park and talk or invite them over to you house. Another reason why I the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things. I hope you have found my interduction good and reading on. My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer fetures. The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted on computer, it's @CAPS1 to go on it some time's but not to much. It is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold. If you have a dog you should take for a walk or walk with your freinds. My next reason is going outside playing sports or running alround playing tag. Instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun thing's you can do outside. You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at. That way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day. The last reason why I perfer nature over computers is learning on how to do something.

My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a that to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes.

However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.

First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say ""@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?"" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to?

Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH1 use ""@CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""@CAPS6 no!"" @CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important.

Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library.     Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded.     Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products.     Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books.     Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it. So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library",4,4,4,6.0

One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face.",4,4,4,10.0

1664,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. ",4,4,8,6.0
15265,6,"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people.",2,3,3,7.5

When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good.

The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents.""

3204,2,"Dear newspaper and staff,               @CAPS1 has came to my attention that @CAPS1 is being considered that most libraries in the community @MONTH1 have a removal and or censorship of some books in the libary. I find this not accepable; in my opinion this is a attempt to mislead or perhaps hide previous evidence of offenisve reading material from futher generations. For example, a personal favorite of mine is a book labled ' A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS1', this book describes a childs heartships and the abuse he takes on a daily basics. Books of this sort are not only imformitive @CAPS1 also gives the reader an open mind on how things might have been. Some topics @MONTH1 include; slavery, abuse, war, and discrimation.                These topics today are still among the things that happen in today's society. Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. @CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!          My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie.           So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks!

Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration.

Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.

The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.

I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended.

There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building.one of the main problems was it was flamable. The helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. If there was the smallest spark the entire Dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example The hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. So the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York it would of been much worse.Another problem with the dirigibles was wind.

4300,2,"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.

Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes.

Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh.",20,22,42,7.0
4108,2,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@ORGANIZATION2",6,6,6,10.0
3145,2,"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them.

Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous.

21098,8," Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM2"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today.",23,20,43,7.166666666666667

A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all.

3561,2,"Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries.     I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like the next person might love. They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material. Then maybe the library should consider removing the item. Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, its many things to choose from. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about situation.     In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense. I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts",3,3,3,4.0

769,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. Teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails what I depend on. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. The use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used.

These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due.

Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever.

9724,4,In the story winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says let me help mother. This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saengs commitment.,2,3,3,10.0
9504,4,"The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.",1,2,2,6.666666666666667
13386,5,"     In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods @PERSON2 created were happiness, humor, and kindness.     The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh.     Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness.     Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.     In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family.",4,4,4,10.0

15762,6,"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents."" Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without blowing away. Another obstacle was safety. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea, there are too many obstacles and hazards preventing it from ever happening.",2,2,2,5.0
21535,8," You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time @DATE1 when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distant between two people."" and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's ""Laughter is the greatest medicine."" I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days.",20,15,35,5.833333333333333
4266,2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,           I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible.",3,3,3,4.0
1648,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit.

686,1,"Dear local newspaper, I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people. My opion on this topic is that computers do have an effect on people. Most people while surfing the internet don't keep track of time. What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that, they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something @MONTH1 pop that catches their intrest and at that same time there focus is on something else. Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house. When many people are on the web they tend not to excersise as much. When in the house on the web most people that excersise stop excersising. The reason why this occurs is because while people are on the computer chair you feel so relaxed and calm that you don't want to get up. This leads into eating unhealthy foods. Some such as chips, donuts, twinkies and etc. Some @CAPS1 do not believe that is an opinion. The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote ""@CAPS2 that are more active are healthier than @CAPS2 that stay on the computer all day. Most @CAPS1 do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active. Not being physically active can lead to A) obesity @CAPS4) cloged arteries or @CAPS5) lazyness. It can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day. Most @CAPS1 should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer. There is a lot more to life than being on the web. Some such as playing sports. Not only is playing sports fun but at the same tim it is also healthy. Would you rather live to @NUM1 or live to @NUM2. And so local newspaper that is why I am writing you this letter today. I mean would you rather have friends @CAPS2 or be lonely. There are weight surgerys but those can rack up to thousands of dollars. And yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death.

First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore.

This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use @CAPS2 for entertainment. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising, exploring nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could get addicted. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so theyre not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of @CAPS2, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas.

3557,2,"What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest.     Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials.     Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure.     Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library.     I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices. Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment.     In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions.",3,4,3,4.0

However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of to much time on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti-social, And lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics, kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but i make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic. That leaves us with so much to explore, we just have to keep on eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti-social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become grued to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly, @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you loose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us if you spend to much time on the computer, you wont have time to enjoy it. There are so many thing that you would be missing out on. Take time out of you day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things outher are so much prettier than you computer screen, trust me. once you cut down you computer time littyle-by-little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth you time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, i hope you think about my opinions i presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti-social. we won't be able to enjoy the nature around us.

Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted.

I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand.      I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous. Its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book. However if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop. I say its a library, let us read what we want to read.     Like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book.

One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city.

14923,6,"In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.",3,3,3,7.5

Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide.

I believe that computers are a negative effect on people vecause people spend too much time on computer; not exercising, there are many dangers, and less interacting with family and friends. First @ORGANIZATION1 all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, @CAPS3 spoke to a local @CAPS2 about this issue and she spoke out, @CAPS3 have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night."" This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past. I try to cut back on my computer times, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. someone's health is very important now. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concern parents have @ORGANIZATION1 computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently the new biggest site is facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is oovoo or skype, which allows you to talk to someone with webcam. There could be a time when a teen ""meets"" someone on-line and agree to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know to see. These sites aren't safe, and knowing youngs they can in danger. @CAPS3 spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are @PERCENT1 dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins it so much better and fun. I do e-mail my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when @CAPS3 have get togethers. Now a day it's not like that for a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people. Many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important.

Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves.      The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them.

21422,8," Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy.",21,20,41,6.833333333333333

3340,2,"There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varities. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well most people find a  lot of things that intrest them in many ways. Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listing, reading, or watching. So many people are diferent and each person likes something diferent from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelfs because they're offensive?'     From experince, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong.  I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magaizine that was not there age group, but @CAPS1 that children wanted to look up on that thing. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age.     As a  parent or legal gardian, most children look up to you. @CAPS1 you read, listin, or watch something that is not to there age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to there parents or legal gardian. They want to @CAPS1 do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find soemthing that is similar to what you doing. They might go find a book, movie, or cd that is not there age group. They will do this all because @CAPS1 they want to be just like there parents or gardian. So as a parent or gardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to you children so they do not find offensive books or ect..           There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today. Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we can not stop that. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not there age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning enviroment for everyone. Just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff.     There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varities they carry. Have you ever thought though, '@CAPS1 its use humans that makes the libraries carry these varities?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library.

486,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much do computers affect our life? I have always thought of that question. Technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier, but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people's work? In everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us. But what about us? Since technology come out people has become not the same; for example cars, by having them people doesn't walk and not even exersice, they don't spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happend outside. I just think that technology like computers take a whole quater of our life by mostly doing the work for us. First, have you ever, notice that people get obiese so fast? I know the answer to that question. The obesitity in @LOCATION1 is getting worst, people are getting fattier by just been in a cautch and sitting with a computer and eating, what exersise are they doing there? People doesn't exersise anymore, instead of them playing games like, soccer, volley-ball, baseball or even running, @CAPS3!! They are at the computer playing games that doesn't do anything good. I have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer, "" I htink that people doesn't think about their health, they just think to make life easier"". I agree with her; obisitty could bring you to the hospital and you don't want that. Second, have you ever asked your self about @CAPS2 much time you ever spend with friends and family? Well think of that. Maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside bu not with your family, but you can see that you're probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer, but not with your family. Spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things. For example family parties, or just watching a show on the t.v. I just think that spending time with your family is important. Lastly, if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer, won't you feel bad if something happend with your son/daughter? In everyway we always miss wonderful things, and sometimes we loose it because of technology, you don't want that right? Imagen you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word won't you feel bad if you missed that? I would. Always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things. In conclusion, so many people have become addicted to computers, they just can't lieve it alone. Imagen that you become one of them. You becoming obise, not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us. I hope you understand that technology is not everything in life.",4,5,9,7.0

Probably not will that computer game running. That wright will keep coming until you can't even move.

A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.      Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings. Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements.      Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree.      A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.      @CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community.",4,4,4,6.0

3893,2,"Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.",4,4,4,6.0
3150,2,"Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.     Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.      In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel.      Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.      Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.      Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people.

I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and, other things. People, professors, historians, and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday. That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life. When I do research on a important person in history, I learned things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer. Also, the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places.

My brother is in @LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public.

They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life.

People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner.  If people want to have heir things shown such, as movies or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate.  Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.  Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do.  Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or want attention.  When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right.  People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard.      I learned to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner.  Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive.

3116,2,"I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar.           I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf.  Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things.     They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example.     We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them",3,3,3,4.0
4663,2,"My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things.      Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored. I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1. I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing.      I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her. News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well.      Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in @LOCATION2 there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong.      I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with",4,4,4,6.0

Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You @MONTH1 learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way be for us. There is still much we dont know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous.

Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement.

However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless.

Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round.

Now I'm very aware of online pedophiles but that can be taken care of by the fact of having friends you know of in real life to sign up as well. Lastly, I have to say computers are just fun to use. Kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer.

Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music.

If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money. In the past @NUM1 years many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line. Another reason why computers dont give you exerise is because of google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories then if you just look it up on google. Another reason why computers dont give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game. Lets say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5 then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typeing a way on a computer game that doesnt help you anywere in life. When you dont go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight.

Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to reasearch euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-. The only reason why I got a bad grade because I depended on the computer for reasearch and it let me down. If I had better hand writing I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benifit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers caust up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give. The library has books so you can reasearch with books insted of computers.

A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination.

A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like?

1498,1,"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it.",4,4,8,6.0

3651,2,"The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already.  A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.  The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.",4,4,4,6.0
1352,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising. Studys show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit it they're business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier , healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.",4,4,8,6.0

We also use computers to look up directions to places we want to go so we don't get lost. School kids benifit from computers a lot because they would have to carry home tons of books but instead they just go on the computer to get the online book instead of carrying home @NUM1 really heavy books. I know I like to go on the computer better then carrying really heavy books home. Also when you look for a home decorator you just go on the computer and look up websites to see some of the work they have done.

Also if you are looking for a job you can look up there website on the computer and avail them to see if you can get an interview rather then wasting your nature going there. I also use the computer to look up ways to get some where and it's a lot easier to do that then to start driving and get lost I know they have gps's now but they cost a lot more then some on a computer you can find out.

4680,2,"Censorship in Libraries     Have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say, ' @CAPS1! That's inappropriate!' If so, I am sure your not alone. Just the other day I was in the library. There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental. I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive. How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? How does this affect the minds of our country's youth?     My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd recieve some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it. I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material.     Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are @CAPS2. New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some @CAPS2 should be removed for the good of the public. It's interesting how these things just slide by the library. I once saw a young by renting a @CAPS4 that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! No one stopped him.     Books are the same way. Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves.

16147,6,"The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible",1,2,2,5.0
15166,6,"Back in the roaring @NUM1's and @NUM2's, New York City was a popular place which needed to adapt to the ways of modernizing travel. A new and fashionable form of travel was the blimp, or the dirigible. These @ORGANIZATION2 balloons had nowhere to dock in the @ORGANIZATION2, and solving that solution was harder than expected.Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building decided that he could use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for these dirigibles. After adapting the entire building for the change, Smith ran into a few problems.The first @ORGANIZATION2 issue surfaced when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This let Smith know that it would be a bad idea to allow any @CAPS1 blimps near as most non-American crafts were filled with ""hydrogen [which] is highly flammable,"" leaving possibility for catastrophe. Another snag was the ""winds on top of the building... shifting due to... air currents"" which would cause the dirigibles to freely and dangerously sway in the wind. With the wind, they could crash into towers and ""would be dangling above pedestrians."" @CAPS2 valves also came into play as there was a preexisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make any dirigible activity with the Empire State Building downright illegal.",4,3,4,10.0
3648,2,"Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open.  You see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media.  The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated, lost forever.  This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people.     Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple.  In the @ORGANIZATION1 it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press.  By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble?  As citizens of the @LOCATION1 we can not let this happen to our great nation.     By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically.  For example take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith.  If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information.  If this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge.     Picture @CAPS2 in the @DATE1.  Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 has taken power and our systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @ORGANIZATION2 cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries.  This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place.  The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus  be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few.       In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few.

20793,8," The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON1.""  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations.",20,22,42,7.0
15686,6,"Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didnt work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected.

3464,2,"Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book  censorship is a big deal in the world today. Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech.     I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing.     Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People @MONTH1 be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without  books.      Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The @CAPS1's of @PERSON1, was a very scandels book. Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The @CAPS1's of @ORGANIZATION1 is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of @CAPS3 history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book.     It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts. Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come?     Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited? Where will it end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselvees this, do we have the right to limit freedom",4,4,4,6.0
15423,6,"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia Lüsted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened.",2,3,3,7.5

People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake.

Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable.

4232,2,"When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea.",4,4,4,6.0

When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow.

1715,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The question is close too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? In my opinion, no computers definitely don't make people lazy and less interactive with others aroud them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news and you can research many different topics. I remember when I was younger I would love to learn about the @CAPS1. I use to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer I got accurate information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used teh computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades. Famous psycologist @PERSON2 says that ""kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people but mostly syudents. But at @ORGANIZATION1 it a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Therefore the computer helps teach everyone facts and many stays on whats going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. i mean there's @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moves to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3. A survey conducted by student council at that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state @PERCENT4 out of taht @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that people don't need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier. Therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. I mean you can do new exercise, train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balon between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it. its easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by @CAPS7 new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games"". I know you @MONTH1 be thinking taht they can just go to someone to teach them BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, @CAPS7 new exercises, moves or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercise that they learn from how to videos.",5,5,10,8.0

3130,2,"offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class.     Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it.     People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors.      Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson.     Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme. secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research.

16415,6,"Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building.",4,4,4,10.0

I have three major memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach, and the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. Staring with with the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbors exchange student @PERSON1 and they are memories, they are not perfect. The @TIME1 I made @PERSON1 smile. It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME1 out on the back lawn of grandmothers house which over looks the @ORGANIZATION1 gorge, perfect for watching the firework show. The lawn was even inclined so the you don't have to sit up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 came over to sit with me as i waited for the show. @PERSON1 sat to the left of me and @CAPS1, my neighbor and life long friend, to the right. I was very curious about @PERSON1, what she was like, what part of @LOCATION3 she lived in, how were her costumes different than ours. So i started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finlay I got a conversation going between the three us us about the fire works that had started. @PERSON1 was telling us how the fire works back home in @LOCATION3 were much bigger than ours. Of course me being sarcastic i said ""@CAPS2 really"". She just smiled. the rest of the @TIME1 the conversations flowed much freer between me and @PERSON1 and it was a wonderful evening. Next we have the day at the beach. This happened about @DATE1 for the @TIME1 memory. @PERSON1 and me were good friends and she had lost her shyness and i was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach the beach down on the @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. It was starting to becoming a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's host sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend), and me. In a bit of a flirting mood I started to splash @PERSON1 who happened to be by @CAPS1. This started a very large splash war with every one splashing everyone else. Every one was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in there face any more. Soon there after I dove under the water an tried to lift @PERSON1 up and then drop her in the water, it underlay failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME1 memory is the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. We had just finished eating dinner and it was @PERSON1's @TIME1 in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By now we were practically boyfriend girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 as we arrived at the @LOCATION4 forMovies in the @LOCATION4.. @TIME1 at the @CAPS7 was playing that @TIME1. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. we lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flash back of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at moment that I was really going to miss her more than i had missed anyone befor. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterward we laughed and cried.

3016,2,"One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.      What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book.     The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries",3,3,3,4.0

Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg.

Its easy to see why adults think kids dont read enough however kids get more than enough reading done on the computer. some parent think that just because kids arent going to the library to take a book out for their report they arent gaining knowlege but they are gaining knowlege because all of the things they could look up in a library they have availible to them on the computer.

It can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the things you can find at the library you can finf on the computer.

Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe.""

Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.

These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.

Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area.

As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still.

3949,2,"The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.     The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.     The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.     If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.     Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?     Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want.",4,4,4,6.0

Just because some people think it's offensive doesnt't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people @MONTH1 like the content it shows.        I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view. If something was removed every time someone would walk in, then there would be no library. A library is supposed to be a variety of books. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes.        It is important to offer alot of variety because if a library doesn't have alot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers. A library doesn't want to target just kids or teen through aduts. The library wants to target all aspects of people. Even if it means that some content is innapropriate. All books are innapropiate if you look at them in the wrong way.       I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view.

Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer.

I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprine... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restraunt/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on histicoral, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything.

When we got done, we @CAPS21 slumped on to the couch looked at each other.

3615,2,"No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our english class. It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too.

There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them.

Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.      There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there.

When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.     Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.     Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.      Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language.

16040,6,"The Mooring Mast On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released to the public the the Empire State Building would reach a towering 1,250 feet, the world's tallest building. To do this they were going to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock Dirigibles. The builders were unaware of the obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, @CAPS1 and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation. (paragraph @NUM1) To do this it would cost over @NUM2$ to make the frame work strong enough to hold the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION2 hydrogen is used to fuel the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable so if anything ever happened over downtown New York. It would be a catastrophe. The greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself. The violent air currents are unpredictible and the dirigible would be shifting around even if weighted down. But it is not practical or safe to weigh the balloon dow with pedestrians below. Overall the outcome of the mast was a fail due to the blindly seen and the blindly predicted obstacles of nature, architecture @CAPS1.",4,4,4,10.0
370,1,"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion.

21500,8," Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life.",17,20,37,6.166666666666667

My opinion on this topic is; I think that both statements are true, yes they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people & also allow people to talk on line with others. If we did not have computers I would not have finfished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts who are spending too much time on thier computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some peopel who have gotten addicted to online video games & wouldn't leave the computer for hours & I know I myself have found new website & want to learn all about it so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statement being true; I do not think computers efefcet on people. Because without computers alot more students would be failing classes & getting zeros// @CAPS1's on projects; class asignments & homework.

21440,8," Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist.",15,19,34,5.666666666666667
654,1,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight.

246,1,"Dear editor, Have you ever would to know something so badly that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had an""ah-hah!"" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? You probably used a computer. All you need to do is type in your request, hit "" enter"" and viola! Your screen fills with choices of information sites. Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to florida. I was devastaded. At first, we tried writing letters to each ohter. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, or connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their futur career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your. Any game you can think can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitare to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. New, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some peole that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read outside. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever wait to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is can all be found with the click of a button. this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in @LOCATION2 or talk to an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer.

For example, I have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer. We talk on webcam and chat. Calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive. If I didn't have a computer then I would not have that great of contact with @CAPS2 family from another country. In addition, You can use the computer to look at foreign countries. Many people including @CAPS2 parents have used the computer to look and read into about other countries. @CAPS2 mother, whenever @CAPS1 plans a vacation, looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it. Like @DATE1 we went to a hot exotic place, @CAPS2 mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there. If it weren't for the computer we might have packed the wrong items. Lastly, computers are a great source for researching. I can't tell you how many times I have used the computer to research. Books and encyclopedias are great sources but the computer has so much to offer. You have so many links you can go to and sites. You can find pictures, videos, maps, and much more. I have used the computer many times to research, sometimes its a requirement to have a few sites you have gone on to research for your project in school or something. If you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school. Computers are a more positive thing than negative. You can talk to people without the expensive phone bill. You can learn about other places and cultures. Also, you can use it for researching purposes. Computers @CAPS3!",4,4,8,6.0

Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject. These technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well @MONTH1 need in any given situation. If you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer, look it up and importance of computers in every day society. Last of all, computer hand - eye coordination that is vital to every day life. Typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere. In fact, many employers @MONTH1 hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they @MONTH1 even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. in conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations.

When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH1 be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh.

358,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personaly disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.

Buying a computer and getting on the computer is free will and the computer dosen't you get on it that's our choice so we can't blame the computer for people not excerising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated. For example there are computer class online for people that want to there degree in different fields, with just a click of a button you it can change you future and career for the rest of you life.

1598,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.",5,5,10,8.0

20842,8," I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought.

It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring.

In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it.""",3,3,3,7.5
3481,2,"Many books in libraries have profanity, it just depends on how you read and anazlyze the profanity. To some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head. To others the words are just offensive. I disagree that most books are offensive to readers I believe that they just help the writers get their points across.      Many children come across books with offensive language, but if they only read books that are within their age level then they shouldn't have these problems. In adult books there is more offensive language, but to adults eyes and ears its a different story because they hear, and possibly say a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books anyhow.     I believe that any offensive reading material should be found and then sent to a certain area of the library where if you are an adult then you can check these books out. This is a way to keep the children away from these books, words, and to keep them 'innocent' still. Children don't need to be reading books with offensive language anyhow, but of course this is up to their guardian.     It's not necassarily a bad thing to have strong language in books, as long as the reader that has the book is taking it in the way the writer is intending, which is most likely to help the theme. Children should be kept away from these books but they should not be completely removed from the shelves. They should just be put in their own area for adults to read only",4,4,4,6.0

You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people.

Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures.

But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.

21006,8," People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well.

During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the @CAPS1 and it is considered comedic. On a hot @DATE1 @TIME1, something quite similar happened to me and my friends.  I live next to the @LOCATION1. I know of this one spot on the @LOCATION1, its called @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because the reflection of the tree's that surround it. The @LOCATION1 is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff-side, which ranges from @NUM1 feet too @NUM2 feet. On the other side of the @LOCATION1, there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive tree's behind it. The hike to @ORGANIZATION1 is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The @LOCATION1 bed and the gorge is lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings.  On this particular day, I was going to bring @CAPS2, @PERSON2, @CAPS3, and @PERSON1. My friend @CAPS2 is a dare-devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also home-schooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about @NUM1 feet off the water. Somehow, @CAPS2 ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a count down. @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @CAPS6! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff-side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knee's to his to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, @CAPS2 tucked but he never rotated. He fell like a rock. His back aimed strait at the water. There was what seemed like a @NUM7 second pause between the moment he jumped off the cliff and the moment he smacked the water. His upper back was the first thing to make contact with the water, there was a giant splash, and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. @NUM5 seconds later, @CAPS2 emerged from the water, he was attempting to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. @PERSON2, @CAPS3, @PERSON1, and I were all on the shore of the beach across the lake! Simultaneously, we looked at each other, nobody was laughing, everyone looked worried. All at once we booked it into the water. It was about a @NUM9 yard swim to get all the way to @CAPS2. I was the first one there. He was panting by then, but he was still in an intense state of panic. I stayed away from him until @PERSON1 got there. @PERSON1 is almost 6'@NUM7 and @NUM11 pounds, so he grabbed @CAPS2 around the torso first. I grabbed his legs, when @CAPS3 and @PERSON2 finally got there they took hold of his arms. We all pulled him to the beach where he could safely put his feet on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked @CAPS2 would have made it to the beach all by himself. Although, it was kind of @CAPS18 fault for pressuring him in the first place.  After almost @NUM5 hours of basking in the in the sun and calming down, the sun started setting behind the gorge, there were shadows closing in on us from the shoreline. It was only @NUM5 @LOCATION2. We decided to explore down the @LOCATION1 a little bit, also to find some more sunshine. We all stood up and noticed that @CAPS2's entire backside was purple! Not only because of his ginger skin, but the impact on the water created quite the contusion. Everyone except @CAPS2 saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened. @CAPS2 looked behind him and saw his discolored back and couldn'@CAPS3 hold back bursts of laughter. Laughter was coming from everyone.  This was the first time that @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I had ever hung out. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we share @CAPS18 @LOCATION1 spot with all of @CAPS18 own other friends but nothing sticks out to me like that day did.

The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to",4,4,4,6.0

This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe.

Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. What if you live far away from the nearest library? When you have to write a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in handy. Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Not only that but also, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" states that information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a lot. Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. Although, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do,"" states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family.

I think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people. Even movies and music can be offensive to some people. I think the music of @DATE1 is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive. Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times.      There are many reasons movies can be offensive. If they are offensive why put them in the libraries? Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products. For example a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that is inaccurrate and poorly made might be offensive to real life @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 veterans. The veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves. I have seen some great @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movies but I have also see some bad ones too. My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and got so upset he cursed at the @CAPS15 and almost threw the remote at it.      Then ther is the problem with the music of @DATE1. I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of @DATE1's rap artists because all the talk about is drugs, sex, and girls. If you ask me its stupid. But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that librariy. Some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex. I just think the most of the music of @DATE1 is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sinces.     Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer. Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why put it on the shelves of libraries then? Well it all lead back to money. If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes. I read a book that was about some one killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them. I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them.     So over all the libraries should be more carefull on what they put on the shelves for people to buy. If the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit.

Insted of beign on the computer just looking for stuff like myspace or facebook, but they should spend time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal expirience, it wasn't me it was my cousin @PERSON1 he got addicted to the computer so much that everytime his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go.

15228,6,"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively.",3,4,4,10.0

I left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead, the same thing bad happened. Luckily, I had my other friends numbers I could use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick her cell and house phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people."" @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care about anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to ou again. and I don't blame her.

To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside.

I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back.

I felt determination flow through my veins. I would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point. @PERSON1 caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but I resisted with all my might.

My friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house. I grasped for the anger that was slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay mad but I couldn't. I started laughing and any tension I still felt swarming around me lifted up and flew away. A grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully. They set me down in the middle of the road.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it.",3,4,3,4.0

Well if you are like the majority of the respectable, caring @CAPS3 in this country you probably answered yes to both of these questions; and you most likely also believe that the computer is a great tool to teach hand-eye coordination, as well as an awesome way to talk with other people online.

4429,2,"Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement.",4,4,4,6.0

3034,2,"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.

This way, we don't have to talk to people in person. it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers. those would be either getting trouble at school, memorizing a phone number and the dialing it, or talking to than in person. Clearly, computers make it easier to talk to people. Next, computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family. You could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat. This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in @LOCATION1 and just recently sent an e-mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people, no matter how far. Secondly, every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game, whether it be by a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many skills. The first skill we could learn is typing. just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you had @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as you can, as fast as you can. If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time. It also gets harder as you go, getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on. Also, a class that at @CAPS4. information processing, is about computer. Once we were finished with our assignments, we could play type to learn @NUM2. That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of games where you need guide-thinking to be able to win. This teaches nto be ready for almost anything. Also, it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision. In real-life situations you @MONTH1 only have a few seconds to react. Games such as these help in real-life situations. The last type of game is the tower defense. This shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it. If we were to evr join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our trops in the best mannor we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to bag upgrades buy @LOCATION1 towers. One decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit. Tower defense games make us make better decisions. Games @MONTH1 be fun, but they teach us skills too. Lastly, computer make things easier and have images on @ORGANIZATION2. One thing that a computer makes easier.",4,4,8,6.0
1600,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you really think we should'nt have computers or @CAPS2 you think we shouldn't? Well I say we should because computers has everything you need as in info, games, school, websites where you can by clothes. Others say no for some reason why they say it's not good for you and to addictive I clearly think that it is appropriate. Having computers, it absolutely helps us learn, whatever you needed to learn a computer has it. If you wanted learn about other places besides the one you live in you could find it on the computer. I remember one time when I was looking for a word in the dictionary and they didn't have it and I looked it up on the computer and they had it I thought it was magnificent. I love computers it connect's me with my family that are in far away places there's nothing better than that because you could talk to your family all day or wherever you want. Computers have everything, any info you need get it off of the computer. It let's you stay alert on what's happening today in the world. It really does work on your hand and eye coordination. ""@CAPS3't that brilliant?"" Some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature. Or people start to not to want to get out of the house, you don't spend time with your family, because your so addictive to it. Some say your not exercising or nothing so you get too fat, or too skinny and your not healthy at all.

No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before.",4,4,8,6.0

My mom wasnt even done still so I told her if I could go working to my friends house. But she said no and that I had to be patience till she was done. My dad was living to his work in the afternoon so I had an idle. I told my dad if he could drop me off my friends house and then he could live to his work. So I did I went to tell him. But guess what he said no coz he was already late and I looked at the time and yhea he was already late so I dicided to just be patience coz my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched tv while my mom was done. My mum had went insid the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said yes I so yelled so you are tackeing me and so she did I was so happy I rushed to the car and so we went and I went and my mom had left and that was the day I got to go to my friends house for just being patience.,8,6,14,4.666666666666667

There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country.      Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber.      As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc",3,3,3,4.0

1373,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are benefitial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about forein people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways.

Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the bigginning.

3528,2,"Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they @MONTH1 be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.      Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them.  If parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.      In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.      Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.      If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults @MONTH1 find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children I wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it.

Most people go the the library to study or use the computers... But what about the other people?     I went to the library and saw racest books most adults would find that offensive especially if its an afracan american. The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to sutdy about the old times it's not there to offend people. Some books are very infromational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesnt happen again.     Another peroblem most people have is with the adult books parents defantly dont want their children looking or checking thoughs books out. But when noone stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certen books.     The last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard. Most parants the to sheild their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when the and go to a comunity plase and just listen to anything that causes a peopblem. Personially I think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore that get little business.     You know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racest, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library. I believe that their should be a vote to see if we could have thoughs books amd music removed or atleast put in an adult section in the back.      My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censioring the books and @CAPS1's they put in the library and make accessalble to the comunity.

21578,8," A couple years ago when I was in middle school I meet one of my bestfriend which who I have great times with. When I first meet her was in math class where she had an assigned seat next to me. We started talking and eventhough we did'nt know each other very well i could say laughter was the closest distance between me and her. We would just laugh at really random things that happened because we did'nt really know what to talk about. Sometimes it would'nt make sence of what we were laughing about. But we laughed any way eventhough we did'nt understand each others jokes.Laughing was something that keped our distance close. Time went by and we became good friends. Laughing was the one thing that keped us cose together because we had nothing better to do. We both are people that like to laugh a lot and if not we get bored. If me or her had no humor when we first meet I don't think we would of got along so well at the end. We did'nt really have anything to do because we did'nt know each other very good. We would only hang out during lunch and any other class we had together but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny which was really dumb. We had nothing better to do.  A couple months latter we seemed to become really close friends and not just in laughter. We knew each other much better and finally had things to talk about and we found out we had something in common. Laughter still had something to do with our friendship but not as much as the begining of when we first meet. During math time we were always talking and laughing at the things we would say. That had never happened before. But now we were able to talk about other things too not just things that made us laugh and we new that laughter is'nt the only thing that is keeping us colse together. Now we had other ways to get along too. We both had friends that we could get along with differenlty. I had some friends with not a really close distance but we would laugh a lot. With some of my other friends I did'nt really laugh that much and we had a very close friendship. My friends and I can get along in different ways not just in laughter. We all have differents ways to get along and have fun. Some of them are really calm and some of them like to laugh a lot like me. Mostly all of the are just the type that like to be laughing all the time but we are closer because of the way we are with each other.  I think that laughing could be the shortest distance between two people. There are other things that can keep two people close together. Laughing does help people have a good time together but I don't think is a big, big part of a friendship. I think its how they get along and if the have somethings on common. It also depends on how they get along and how they treat each other. Everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so I think it's different for everybody.",16,16,32,5.333333333333333

To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas.

3309,2,"I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish",4,4,4,6.0

1264,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers people arnt being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising, they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the @LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers arn't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on facebook or myspace, e-mailing or @CAPS3-ing each other. Sometimes they arn't even talking to who they believed they were, it not only dangerous but unhealthy also. Whats wrong with giving someone far away a call?

It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit infront of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much.

A computure can not provide fitness, real interactions with friends of family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight because of a lack of exercising? Acording to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. a @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to sociaty? Anotherthing on that topic is that overweight children that spend @NUM1 hours. Put off healthy activatys such as basketball or tennis wich also leaves them socialy behind and lacking he healthy experiences wich leads me to my next point. People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer. For example you @MONTH1 read about world war @CAPS2 but you realy know what people were thinking or what the combat fealt like? A computer can not teach you how to feal only a real life experience can do so. Many if you were deployed to an army write in @LOCATION1. You would know what its like to be in war. but playing a game or reading an article don't provide experience.

Their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the @CAPS3 all the time but the only why to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was threw the @CAPS3. Unlike most relationships that sucseed.

3896,2,"What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of.  Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing.  Does censorship really help in our society?  Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory.  How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings.     Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows.  In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version.  Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, beacuse it's more than likely more funny and shows more.  Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version.  I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version.  Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television.  Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words.  That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later.     Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows.  I cant say that I dont watch shows that have some language in them nor can I say that I dont watch shows that are all bloody and gory.  I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister!  She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her.  Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie.  I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either.  Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Right?     Last but not least, my readings about, lets say books and/or music lyrics.  So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it.  Some songs cant be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and through out the song.  That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular.  I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were.  When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me.  Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use.     Censorship can be good or bad, it really depends on how you look at things.  Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do.  My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good.",4,4,4,6.0
4723,2,"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem.

I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   ",25,20,45,7.5
3445,2,"I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone @MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion. What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions. Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs.    If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed.    Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.",4,4,4,6.0
3284,2,"Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society.      Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader @MONTH1 be offended.     In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship.     For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The @CAPS1' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs?      These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you @MONTH1 be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one",4,3,4,6.0

T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Heres a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. Its unbearable to watch. Ambulences sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And thats @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, Id lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadnt made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, Id still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe its just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldnt know because in no way we we typical. When we arent fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. @CAPS4, @CAPS5 starts, I know I havent been patient with you lately, and for that Im sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing. I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself? @CAPS5 didnt have to explain any farther. @CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around, my voice caught in my throat, just to get my stupid notebook. A single tear weaved its way down my face. @CAPS7, hunny! my mother teared up as @CAPS6. That doesnt make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way! I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. @CAPS8, I said, regaining composure, thats how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8. @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mothers lips. I will wait then. And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg.

I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter.

3594,2,"Censorship?  What is it?  Well from what i know cenorship is where you are blocked from certin things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it.  So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, i think that libraries should be able to censor certins things that people find offensive.  First reason why i think it is right that people should be able to censor things is becuase little childeren could be able to take at peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies.  Next reason why i think labraries should be able to cenor is because people can find centin things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and aslo also naughty things can be watched in movies.  My last reasoning why i think it is fair that libraries are able censor things is beacuase some people like to read but in thier reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a labrary.  These are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines.     My first reasoning in why i think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little childeren could be able to look at things things they should not be able to take a peek at.  Thses things could be like pronogaphy, and also really grusome things in magazines and in movies.  If these things were in labraries they can possibly show other childeren, inwhich it would not be good.  This can be a problem beacuase parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children.  Also i think think they should be able to censor movies beacuse little childern shouls not be watching gursome movies at a young age.  This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines.  Also labraries can censor music.      I also think libraries can censor music beacause in music these days there are very bad things that any body can find that is offensive.  Little childern can be listenig to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people.   This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying,  so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners.  Also they should be able to censor movies again beacuse naughty things can be shown in those movies that certin age levels should not be able to see.  These are ressons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies.   They aslo have right to censor books.      Books in they libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certin books such as books about faith and other religions.  And also about gursome items.  Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people @MONTH1 not see eye to eye about other religions.  And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so peolpe won't find it be offensive.   And also libraries should be censoring certin books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive.  So this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things.     In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death,  movies beacuse in some movies it can show pronography and gursome things that peopel should not be watching,  and they should be able to censor magazines and music beacuse in magazines childern could be looking at certin things they shouls not be looking at.  And they should be able to censor music beacuse peopel can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language.  So in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines",4,4,4,6.0

To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?.

Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them.

Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""",4,4,4,10.0

My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life.

3552,2,"Take it @CAPS1?          How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you? How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things? The truth is we can not stop them, their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere. It is all over the internet and you can't control that.     If I find something very offensive in a store or online I should have the right to voice my opinion, and that opinion should be taken seriously. They shouldn't have inappropiate things in public stores or places children can go. That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids. Some people should just know better and take it @CAPS1.     Almost every day that i go online, i see something on the side of the website advertising some kinda of pornograghy site. Its unbelievible how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see. If they're going to continue to do this, @CAPS2 needs to be some law saying they can not on public sites. I see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and i know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages.     I understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others. Selling movies, magazines, and music saying or doing things that are rebelious is easy money for opper teens and older people. They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornography things, everyone loves to watch, read, or listening to something funny.     So basicly we aren't going to stop this completely and you all should know that. the best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day. It should die down eventually. We can only hope for the best",3,3,3,4.0

So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all",3,3,3,4.0

Therefore I think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize. Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantacy, family and friends, and your health. Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumtion that everything you see on the computer is true. Well, as some find out it is everything but that. The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you see are real life situations and activities. Computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in. It affects school work and how they behave. They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality. Your family and friends have always been there for you. By your side even through your worst. Unfourtunetly, this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them. They are not happy with the way you treat them. They want a change so you can enjoy life again. Interact with a human being, not some graphic designed computer picture. That's all it is anyway, and that picture isn't going to be there for you. Your family and friends last longer than that. Your body is special and your health is important. A computer @MONTH1 suggest exercise but you are not going to really do it. You know that and the people who make computer sites know that. Your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day. It is not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise. Your already sitting anyway, so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself. You need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature. Run around or play a bill game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can see how a computer can effect a person. Not only do they mistake fantacy and reality as the same thing, but you lose interaction with your friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because honestly, we are losing the chance to live and enjoy the world.",5,4,9,7.0

In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem.

Although the memories are foggy, i can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the @DATE2 I was twelve, I remember @CAPS7 adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS2 alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS7 trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON1 and she was @CAPS7 best friend.  @PERSON1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS3 our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove up to @PERSON2 to @PERSON1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS7 spine. @PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS7 heart and soul. Next to her, i was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. ""@CAPS1 wow, finally @DATE2 has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded,"" @CAPS2 another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. @CAPS6.. its the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS3 was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood.  I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its pray. When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to to find @PERSON1. As I turned towards @CAPS7 destination again, a branch met @CAPS7 vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down @CAPS7 chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON1 sprang to @CAPS7 side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.   Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was @CAPS2 @CAPS4 made me cry; @CAPS3 was @CAPS7 appearance that had me down. People would asked for days ""@CAPS4 is on your face"" and ""@CAPS5! How did that @NUM1 came to @CAPS7 side and squeaked, ""@CAPS6, how are you?""@CAPS7 face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to @PERSON1 and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""@CAPS8! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON1. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!""@CAPS7 friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON1 burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS7 arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""@CAPS10,"" she called out to me, "" I'm @CAPS2 agreeing with you in anyway. @CAPS6, you @MONTH1 have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS7 cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and each stitch, I laughed along with @PERSON1 to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS3 builds an everlasting, friendship.     ",25,25,50,8.333333333333334

There one of the greatest inventions.With computers you can listen to music or watch @CAPS1, research things for your projects, or just have a good time. Computers help people create, listen to, watch and make music and @CAPS1. When you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music. And where does eating that music need to go? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals. You can also watch @CAPS1 on there! Not exactly @CAPS1 but whatever show you'd like to see. Some people even create movies on special programs. Thats not all though. Alot of questions can be answered on the computer by doing research. Cures for different disease like cancer can be found. Even small research projects like ""Who founded @CAPS2"" can easily be found with one quick google search. Yeah we might be getting lazy but it makes peoples lives simpler. For instance intead of reading through dozens of books you could just search it on the internet for the answers. You can even take classes online not impressed? Another great effect of people on computers is socializing and having fun. Socializing over computers @MONTH1 not be as effective as socializing in person but it gives the quieter people. like me , a chance to say whats on their mind.

The computer is @CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. When the people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what websites to go to and what to download or watch. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. For example, they can create points and presentation to providea @CAPS1, students can on what they learned at school. @CAPS1, you can make for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said ""@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing"".

Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, every day life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm which isn't ""laughter"" but to some people it could be or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it,don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape or form. Most people have heard the saying, ""it takes more muscles to frown then smile,"" that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affectionate that he can be by sharing our laughter together, brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a a sense of humor is a important thing in a relationship, to most people. @CAPS1 would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who @CAPS2't make you laugh when your sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, by laughing with someone it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about.

How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very ""humorous"" and @CAPS2't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people then someone who brings me down! I consider, laughter to be one of the most important things in my life, and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, "" @CAPS2't it ever get old being happy all the time?"" ""Of course not!"" I would say in defense. @CAPS1 would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time, would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner.  In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and @CAPS1 it's important, there are titled to their opinion.

Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section.

As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose.",3,3,3,7.5
16204,6,The builders faced some problems such as weather conditions. The winds were violent from changing wind currents. Another was the law of how close an aircraft could be to a building. Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place. The builders would have to strengthen the buildings skeleton in order for it to work. This they did. Another problem is some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen. This makes them highly flamable. With others made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians. These are the problems they faced.,3,2,3,7.5
3991,2,"Magazines and Books     I am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violant roles in it.     First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. @CAPS3 me personally like books that have violance and graphic language in them @CAPS3 that just makes the book so much more interesting. And when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. And @CAPS1 boadcasters need to watch what they put on the air @CAPS3 some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch.      The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. I dont think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violance or hearing words that are graphic. But its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. @CAPS3 it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that.     And its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to. @CAPS3 there is more cerse words in the @DATE1 than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazies. Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to picures.me myself dont really look at magazines @CAPS3 they dont really intrest me I would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on @CAPS1.     Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids. I think the libraries shoul have different rooms that have different types of book in them. @CAPS3 if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphis pictures or that just are not suitable for children.      That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. Kids dont need to know bad language at their age @CAPS3 that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them. And reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder mikght get it in a little kids head that that is ok. And that is not ok with me",4,4,4,6.0
15827,6,"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe.""

Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about the current events.

21438,8," Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS1 tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say ""@CAPS4 sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile.",23,23,46,7.666666666666667

This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating.

Next, computers are agreat way for many people to pass some free time. Many websites are designed for this reason. Some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch video made by other people, while some people @MONTH1 spend to much time on this many offers know moderaton and spread their time even other websites hard videos that are used to portray important issues, for example the president has given many through @CAPS4 videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. Lastly, computers are a great way to communate with distant firends and family. There are so many ways to do, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. My family being immigrants from another country my family. Thinks this is a vauables tool for talking with our family, and I am sure that htere are many ohters who use the computer this way as well. People also make and keep in touch with great friends through the @CAPS4. I use @CAPS3-mail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that I haven't seen in tears, my parents have also found long lost friends that they had before we moved through facebook I also allows people to communate important ideas faster than a letter could.

13471,5,"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet.""

3323,2,"It seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in today's world.  In magazines, in books, in the lyrics of music, the possibilities of where to sneak in offensive references are endless, and they certainly pop up everywhere these days.  But should your resources of where you find these materials be limited due to other people's morals or values?  I disagree with this act, and I would like to tell you why I do.     All of us have different morals, values, and sences of what is right and what is wrong; everyone's are different.  Maybe it's your religion or culture that keep you from these materials.  But why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library?  I know I don't just speak for myself when I say I would be very annoyed if I couldn't get the books or materials I wanted or needed just because the person next to me doesn't agree with what is being found through researching it.  I do believe certain things should be seperated from other parts of the libraries.  For example, books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library.  That is completely understandable.  But when things are being removed because certain peolpe don't agree with them or find them offensive, that is when things are going too far.  This nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in.  So why should we force others to believe something we think?  Just because I find something offensive, doesn't mean the person next to me does, which is completely fine with me.  That is his or her own personal opinion, and what I believe should not keep him or her from learning about the things they would like to.  One way to fix this problem would be to seperate things that could possibly be found offensive into another section of the library and to put out a sign or paper saying what exactly can be found in that section.     In conclusion, no, I do not think libraries should be censored.  I know I could walk into my local library and find things I found offensive right now, but I would not want my own opinion to effect someone else's viewing of that material.  People should think about one another once in a while and not be so stuck on what they personally believe.  The world is an opinionated place, if it were not we would have nothing.  A library can be filled with usful materials, so the focus should be on what you can find in a library to help you, not on what is in the library that you do not want to see.  If you find something offensive, simply stay away from it, but don't try to take it away from the rest of the world.",4,4,4,6.0
865,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with.

21467,8," It was my first year of @CAPS1. high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION1 and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION1, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM1 grade rivalry.",25,20,45,7.5

My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opossed to a book or going to the library; which is very time consuming Not only does a computer take for less time to get information, it also holds a much large amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, but best of all, its right your fingertips.

Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load. So, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton. Safety was also an issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire. There was also an existing law stating ""airships can't fly to low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""

In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences.     I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.

4063,2,"Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and thats what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts.     In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books.  The rights have always been there but not fully practised. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines. They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school.      We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about. So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive. I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen.

I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. or not harmful.

(her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern.

I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking.

The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support.

The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself.

20860,8,"                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.",20,18,36,6.0

743,1,"To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how make fire"" a google and @NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin @CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them.

Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to!

21424,8," Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through.",20,18,36,6.0

The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1). Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2). All of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why, the mast was unrealistic.",3,3,3,7.5
903,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers. Because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn.",4,4,8,6.0
21013,8,I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him alot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things i do to help out my peer's . I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and reacact to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so thats what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldnt like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldnt want them to make fun of me thats why you should treat your peers with respect.,10,17,24,4.0

This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.",3,3,3,7.5

3512,2,"Libraries are public for a reason, and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment. I know some people have their opinions about things but that is why there are variaties because every single person is different. In my opinion no I do not think certian materials should be banned becuase they @MONTH1 have a more mature content than others think is appropiate. Disagree with me that is alright but, have you ever stopped to think about issues like this? Im going to list a few reasons with explainations on my opinion becuase I think they @MONTH1 point out a few good concepts on why I do not believe they should be banned.     First, in the present society everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed. The public has a right to entertain themself any way they would like to choose and with any material or subject matter they would like. Taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like, or drive the car they want. If you were to walk into a library and see a subject that does not fit your standards or interest than you should simply walk away and find a more suitable subject matter for yourself. Some people look at things in a totally different way than you, @CAPS1 because you do not like different styles of entertainment does not mean somebody else dosen't.       Second, You would be takng jobs away from many people who love what they do. People have an issue with some content of books, or movies, but that is sometimes based on what an author is feeling, or even what their life maybe like. Others they write about real life events things that happen to normal people everyday, that should be looked up upon to have people write their stories down for the whole world to see. Criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art. Pretty much what people feel like is, its not ok to have a mature subject discussed about in a book but in a painting it is, very hipocritical.     Lastly, If the material being pulished today was wanted off the shelfs of a library, than why would it even be printed and sold to people all over the world? It is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever.      In my opinion i do not think any form of entertianment should be banned or taken away from society in anyway, because than you would be taking peoples joy",4,4,4,6.0

They need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world. because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older.

I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS1 in front of the @CAPS2 so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside.

Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship.

However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. All in all, it was very unrealistic to more dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe.",3,3,3,7.5

It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"".

21348,8,"  In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person be a close friend, a significant other, or a family member. The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches, bring us up when we are down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand, someone we share everything with including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones that get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently this guy, @PERSON1 and I have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that I talk to abut the situation say the same thing, ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room I had a feeling that @DATE1 was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band and I am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for @DATE1, we were supposedly talking to much. I don't believe we were talking to much, because @DATE1 was where I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty-five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug, and start making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes, and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class, made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth, and give their advice, because they are always right so don't second guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone, we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh.",20,19,40,6.666666666666667

First of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the empire state building.

15382,6,"The builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparant reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flamible. This would make the docking Station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the Station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the empire state building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings. The docking station was unable to be built because of safty reasons and existing laws.",4,3,4,10.0

While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive.  When the book, magazine or movie was create, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive.  A group of people @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about.  There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive.     The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon.  No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music.  If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it.  Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong.  There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people.  To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task.  Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries.  If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book.  The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it.     Everyone has a different view on things.  Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different.  This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people.  For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on.  This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy.  If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it.  Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong.  There are many personal reasons why someone @MONTH1 be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public.  People @MONTH1 miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it.  If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one.  No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to.

Also in this memoir the mood is shown by gratefulness by the line, I will always be grateful to my parents. Lastly, the author creates a mood bravery and caring.

4254,2,"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right",4,4,4,6.0
4101,2,"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them",4,4,4,6.0

If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive.

They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself.     Censorship is the underlying problem to many things.  It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films.  If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth.       Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real.  So real that we don't think that it's possible.  We don't want to believe something like 'The @CAPS1' could happen.  'The @CAPS1' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home.  Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth.  Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it.  Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries.  But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house.  Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy.  It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship.  If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves.     The loss of books has been seen throughout history.  Most prominantly, the nazi regime.  In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals.  The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset.  The movement swelled and the  @CAPS3 people soon developed a national pride and goal.  By the @DATE1's, nearly every @CAPS3 who could read had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'.  The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas.  That was how @CAPS7 was actually voted in.  Many don't realize, but the @CAPS8 actually did vote @CAPS7 to be leader.  Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own.     The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge.  The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates.  If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words.  The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are.  Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad.  If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own.",4,4,4,6.0
16391,6,"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock",4,4,4,10.0

The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings.

412,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I beleive that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects of places you think are interesting you don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know any thing about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2"" in a google search, and press enter. There you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. You could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at anytime. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Seond, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. We are depleeting our oxygen supply and destroying habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use to send documents and papers, we could bring to tax appointments and pair suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could asign the homework email it to the student the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for somethings, but we would be using in way less. People could also use less fossil. We could talk via the internet and things like skype to communicate witness waring to and burn. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments, more efficient travel and even every day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also hep us find more efficient way. They could help find a mroe efficient feel, efficient of it could help make a teleportation device. It could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every day life. When you get up in the @TIME1, imagein being able to screen and being able to have a hot shower, your breakfast and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of any reasons for having computers from school reasearch to space and beyond.",6,4,10,8.0
1620,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers dont because you cant get exercise if youre always on the computers and @CAPS2's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? @CAPS2's proven that more than half of united states of @CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @CAPS2's true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @CAPS2's not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but @CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play @CAPS2 with your fmaily. To answer the question everyone is asking I believe that computers don't benefit society at all and hopfully I have encouraged you to believe this too. ",3,4,7,5.0
21291,8," My friend @ORGANIZATION2 received a random phone call in the @TIME1. It was his friends from high school there were three of them. The weird thing about that is they haven't talked much since high school. Surprised @ORGANIZATION2 asked what was going on and how they were doing: assuming they were in jail or something in that matter. Instead the friends replied and told him how they was doing and then told @ORGANIZATION2 they wanted to go on a road trip. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself ""why the heck are you telling me about this"", and then said cool. what do you need from me? The friend replied saying he needed @ORGANIZATION2 to plan the trip because they did not have computers and they couldn't read maps. at the end of the phone call @ORGANIZATION2 finally said he would help and plan the trip out. Then asked the friend were he would want to go for this trip, The friend replied I don't know i wanna see a professional baseball game and were ever @ORGANIZATION1 land is i would love to go there. A week and a half went by later @ORGANIZATION2 called his friends back to tell them the plans. Proudly he said after his hard work of planning for them. its a ten day trip for you guys starting in @LOCATION1 then driving down to @LOCATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 and on the way down and back hit up (watch) a game from all five of the professional baseball teams down in @LOCATION2, then go to six flags another amusement park like @ORGANIZATION1. The friends replied what do you mean you guys? You are coming with us. @ORGANIZATION2 was super surprised and told them :you guys haven't talked to me in about five years and then you randomly want to go on a road trip with me he said sounding kind of confused. The friends replied well we need your car and we don't know how to drive and again we don't know how to read maps. Thinking hard about the situation @ORGANIZATION2 finally caved in and told them yes but then gave conditions. He split up tasks for his friends so he wouldn't be stuck with all of the work.For example he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and places to stay, another was finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants they were going to eat at.  The trip had started and for @ORGANIZATION2 the vacation was much needed and unexpectedly fun and relaxing. At lest for now. Everything was going through and working according to plan they hit up and joyfully watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time, then @ORGANIZATION1 land went above and beyond expectation, and even six flags was exiting and brought @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends back to feeling like they were in the good old high school days.The only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone. the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly setup. but for the hotels they were kind of last minuet. Last few days before heading back plans were still going accordingly.They just had one more event. the giants baseball game, then stay with there old high school buddy who moved down to @LOCATION2. making sure they would have a place to stay for sure @ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay. The friend replayed with a""no i haven't talked to him yet. i will call him later.""this made @ORGANIZATION2 a little uneasy, so he told his friend no call him now.the friend did.There other friend picked up to bring bad news he was back in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self I knew this trip was to good to be true. On the @TIME1 of the baseball game things felt rushed. @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends had to leave really early because the traffic in @LOCATION2 is so random and bad. Mean while @ORGANIZATION2 for got to use the restroom and two hours into the trip to the giants game things started to take a bad turn. @ORGANIZATION2 had to go bad. But his friends kept him going saying the traffic is good we need to keep going. which @ORGANIZATION2 listened and kept going. Then traffic came to a stand still. @ORGANIZATION2 was going to go in his pants!so he pulled off and drove down the side of the high way surprised he didn't get pulled over he miraculously ended up at giants stadium then he saw a portable potty he pulled over and raced to it,it was locked. @ORGANIZATION2 looked around and saw another one. he takes off as fast as he could for it. And yes it was open finally @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self ecstatically! he stepped inside but then looking at the urinal he realizes he didn't get there fast enough and embarrassingly he went in his pants.",15,15,30,5.0
21432,8," Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion.",27,20,50,8.333333333333334

20823,8," Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language.""",21,20,41,6.833333333333333

723,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.",5,5,10,8.0

If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning.

3496,2,"Dear, Newspaper editor          I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the murchandise, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play.      What I believe to be crude, @MONTH1 for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased. I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable. Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it. This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library.      The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me. This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would. This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.     I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence.

The frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so the had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present. The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. A couple of attempts have been made but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. ,3,3,3,7.5

1636,1,"It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",5,5,10,8.0

4057,2,"I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like @CAPS1 shouldnt be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because @CAPS1 might help someone one day. Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because @CAPS1's not treating people right. Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch. Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, @CAPS1 can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and @CAPS1 can also teach us more about offensive material.      Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject. As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material. Why would you ask i do this? Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about @CAPS1. Like where did @CAPS1 come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know. So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about @CAPS1 or know where @CAPS1 came from. Its good to still have have books that are  offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive.     Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books. Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days. In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries. Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days. Well in the library they will have generations of  books on offensive material. This provides us of offensive material back in the old days. So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know  about what happend back in the old days.     Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book. Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material. Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read @CAPS1 and learn more about. Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when @CAPS1 is on offensive material. Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to. If the libraries take away the offensive material @CAPS1 is just like talking a good book from you.      People can think what they want to think about offensive material. Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader. People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books. If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about @CAPS1.

21532,8," ""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond.",25,25,50,8.333333333333334

So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level.

She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone",4,4,4,6.0

But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person.

Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.     Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive.

16454,6,"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast.

When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted..     At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.      Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.     Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate.

4208,2,"One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted.       Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar.  We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.       Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself.  '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  In any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose",5,5,5,8.0

The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there.

458,1,"Dear editor, I understand that some children and adults love going on the computer, but they dont know what the bad effects are. When your at a young age, anything can happen, while your on the computer, even worse things can happen. You could do bad things over the internet, won't exercise, or have time for your family. First of all, what I mean by bad things I mean, your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a facebook account, most of the times the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable then they would end up kidnapping them. Also you could harass people or get harrassed yourself. And you can go on inapropriate websites. Secondly, you act enough generation child I go outside basically, it all kids. Lastly, your child won't have family time. Now with more technology coming out like cellphones, and laptops; kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with the families. I could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the times not good because you can do bad things by talking to strangers, harrassment, and you can go on inappropriate websites. you won't get enough exercise and you can suffer from diabetes, high and childhood obesity. Lastly, you won't have enough family times mainly because of all of the new technology that has come out such as cellphones and laptops.",4,5,9,7.0

21065,8," When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget.",25,22,47,7.833333333333333

Well you can always checks information online, @CAPS3 you ever forget! So there, you can be on task and get ready early. For example, you need to know what time a movie starts at the movie theatre so you check online! Also, you can forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework, so you check online!

Or how much would it cost? Or have you ever wanted to learn about a famous person, for example, @PERSON1? Instead of going to the library and reading through all these books to learn something, you can just go online! There are millions and millions of websites about places and people. Therefore, it makes it much easier to learn about a certain place, person or thing. The computer can be really helpful and useful.

Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life.

4256,2,I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with  the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read. But no by far I  think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say.      But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying  something different but its not it is just worded differently. But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market. Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive.     Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you. Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding  it could be about  something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they dont like they  should stop reading.      I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like. But to others its does nothing to them. I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that.      This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book. Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all.     I really feel like am on both sides,3,3,3,4.0

For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem.

3601,2,"Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the things books are written about. Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and innappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing? Books have been an important tool for students for a long time. However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children. Books are censored for all sorts of reasons. Some of these reasons are frivelous and should not keep a book from reaching it's full potential. The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line, and are banned. Great. However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless. Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves.     If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it. However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author @MONTH1 have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work @MONTH1 be recognized. Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves.     Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service. If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read.     If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone. Just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book. If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book @MONTH1 have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read. However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make.     Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book. Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives.

15318,6,"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred, ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen. Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. The obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the moore mast on the building.",4,4,4,10.0

Me @CAPS11 my three friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @CAPS11 @CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind.

The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned.

Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. Other people just @MONTH1 be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries?     Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies.

If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in.

First of all, computers are not good for your eyes because computers are like @CAPS3's is the something but not really because computer as more information and @CAPS3 dont really got so much information you could browse for. My second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more.

My second reason, is that why people get in computers alot well peopel get on computers just to their or do their taxes but that is not good because just because your doing your bills or your taxes you  to alot of information that people in other countries or state could get without you knowing , second is that people or get on computers to pay their bills or do their taxes they also get on the computer to maybe order something or buy a ticket to fly to a place they want to go like a vacation place or a business trip. my third reason is that they not only buy or order things but thet get in websites that will make their lives better like meeting soembody special or something else. As you keep reading you will find out my third reason for being to much and so long in the computers. My third reason, is that their are alot of activities to do in the computer for a example myspace, facebook and twitter are the most popular website that people get in just to meet new people and talk to old friends.

Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data.

So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily.

I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library were a child shouldn't have access to. Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book. In some libraires there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldnt be allowed. So i believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books.     The same thing applies in a store. In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see. I know in the grocery store that i go to there are inaproperiate images and words that a child should see or read. So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day i was in the store and i saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it. So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place were children shouldn't get access to them.     In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time. The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it. This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the @CAPS1 for the child to listen to. So if the parent buys the child that @CAPS1 that is bad it is the parents fault. But i think that the @CAPS1's for little children should be in one part of the store and the @CAPS1's for the older people should be where the can get access to it.     This same thing applies with movies. There are movies in stores that are rated from @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, @CAPS6, and even for @CAPS7 audiences only. In a bunch of the movies form @LOCATION1@NUM1 abd up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see.

Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywere else. Even if the chid reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book. In the movies that a child is not suppost to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that cuses that child will see that movie and will show there friends or get ideas form the movie.

296,1,"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, & I think that computers are very usefull and that people learn a lot from them. The computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented. Computers help when you need to know something about a certian person. @CAPS3 example is it helps students with homework. Last reason of why I think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends. First example of why I think computers are usefull is they help you if you need facts about a person. One example is you want to go to your a policeman and your leader tells you to meet him at @ORGANIZATION1, so you go there and he tells you the person they are going after but you dont know anything about him and you need a computer to see what he is convicted for and see his criminal record. @CAPS3 example is if your teacher wants you to do a report about"" @PERSON3 lopez,"" but you don't know anything about him so you would use the computer and read about his life. Last example is if you want to learn about your countries history and the leaders behind it then you would use the computer. Second example is students and their homework. One example is when your teacher says ""I want a essay on @PERSON2 and I want it to be neat."" But you have very handwriting and you cant do it on paper you will have to use word or a writing program on @CAPS3 computer. @CAPS3 example is if you forgot to write down your homework in your agenda or something then you can go on the school website and see what your homework is. Last example is if your teacher says find the book about the @CAPS1 and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow. So you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book. Last reason of why I think computers are helpfull in this society is because they help you get a hold of your friends & family. One example is if it takes to long to write letters to each other so you run use online messengers for example like ""@CAPS2"" or even ""facebook and myspace."" @CAPS3 example is if you don't send the letter to the write addrees so what you do is go online and ask a friend or family member.

3868,2,"Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. Its altering a authors work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture",4,4,4,6.0

3922,2,"Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it.  Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4. @NUM1 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section.

3539,2,"Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves",4,4,4,6.0

3160,2,"What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home.     I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle.     If we take peoples choice away what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one. I would not like that. Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, i would not be able to read as much. I mean what do you think?      Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have some one with you every step of the way. Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schdule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop some one from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out. What do you think",3,4,3,4.0

21111,8," Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it""",18,18,36,6.0
4379,2,"There is many different topics that could be offensive, @CAPS5 just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinons. If someone comes from a different country or evern a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way.      When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inapropriate topics for younger childeren read books like that. @CAPS5 is a little bit different with a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think @CAPS5 is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone.      In the book, 'A @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say @CAPS5 is too graphic for children but the reality of @CAPS5 is, events like those happen in today's society. @CAPS5 really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read @CAPS5. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe @CAPS5 had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation.      Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying @CAPS5 is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds. @CAPS5 could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitvie topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? @CAPS5 would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in.      I have also read a book recently titled, '@CAPS6', @CAPS5 is about the government granting the ability to @CAPS6 your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. @CAPS5 is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. @CAPS5 states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. @CAPS5 shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views.      Racism, abortion, @CAPS3 abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case @MONTH1 be, some people will support @CAPS5 and some will not. I think @CAPS5 is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truely believe in and taking 'offensive' material from @CAPS2 libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about @CAPS5, the author had to have had a reason to write @CAPS5 and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs",4,4,4,6.0

In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saengs mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation.

21266,8," This is the second time I have been to @ORGANIZATION1 and I can't wait to go on all the rides. The lines are extremely long but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS1 was going to be a rather warm day today so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM1 so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on ""@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1"", we decided @CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food, so me and my uncle decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me I had won.  Once we ate our food and went outside to leave he told me, ""@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". I not thinking about @CAPS1 said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants-ed me in the middle of the walk way. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pant's at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall for his trick. I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS1 again. @CAPS1 happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other then chuckle inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud crazy kids that always have energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @CAPS1 anymore so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I got hit in the back again so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the kid wasn't my brother and could only imagine what that kid was feeling like.",19,19,38,6.333333333333333

4539,2,"Everyone is @CAPS1          @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are @CAPS1 so we all have @CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good.     When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If  picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they @MONTH1 feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly @CAPS1. Everyone is @CAPS1 and feels diferently about issuses. There is no way to make sure that @CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person.     The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we @MONTH1 find offensive.     In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending  people. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries",4,4,4,6.0

If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that.

3693,2,"I understand how some people @MONTH1 get offended by some things they @MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie.     Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it.     If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all.

For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country.

4260,2,"Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you.  You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off.  I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf.  It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazine, or many others.  The authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too.  There are many reasons why and I will explain this to you.     The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place.  I mean if somebody walks into a library and trys to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one?  A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending.  It was talking jokes about black people.  I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe.       The next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down.  If somebody gets offensive about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low.  No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it.  How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offensive by it?  If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it.     The last reason is to get rid of the materials.  Nobody wants to look at something that offends them.  How would you feel that you took a movie home to watch the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didnt like it.  You get offended and complain.  Complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building.  If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems.     I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if sombody if offended by it.  There are really three main reasons.  One is the the person might never come back to that place. Next, is that it could cause rate success drop down low.  The last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains.  Now, what do you believe",3,3,3,4.0

4190,2,"@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now.  The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today.  In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'.     Censorship, what does that mean to you?  To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things.  In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries.  Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong.  Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us.     In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us?  In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights.  Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society.  Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material.         @CAPS1 now?  Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to.  Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen.  There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that.       In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions.  When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger.  Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in.  Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are",4,4,4,6.0
15653,6,"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose.""",3,3,3,7.5
3207,2,"Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings. IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age. People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d. for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit. And most apparent if it offends you dont read it.     Simply follow the rating rules. Take necesary precations.

And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life @CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, @CAPS1 they respec us too. tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why",3,3,3,4.0

First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going.

3168,2,"Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general",4,4,4,6.0
